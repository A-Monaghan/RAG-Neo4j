    "text": "Editors Summary: The expanding need for an open information sharing infrastructure to\npromote scholarly communication led to the pioneering establishment of arXiv.org, now\nmaintained by the Cornell University Library. To be sustainable, the repository requires careful,\nlong term planning for services, management and funding. The library is developing a\nsustainability model for arXiv, based on voluntary contributions and the ongoing participation\nand support of 200 libraries and research laboratories around the world. The sustainability\ninitiative is based on a membership model and builds on arXiv’s technical, service, financial and\npolicy infrastructure. Five principles for sustainability drive development, starting with deep\nintegration into the scholarly community. Also key are a clearly defined mandate and\ngovernance structure, a stable yet innovative technology platform, systematic creation of content\npolicies and str ong business planning strategies. Repositories like arXiv must consider usability\nand lifecycle alongside values and trends in scholarly communication. To endure, they must also\nsupport and enhance their service by securing and managing resources and demon strating\nresponsible stewardship.\nOver the past two decades, advancements in information and communication technologies have\nushered new modes of knowledge creation, dissemination, sharing and enquiry. Open access has\nemerged as an alternative and viable publishing model and an increasingl y vital component of\nthe scholarly communication infrastructure. The vision of an open and robust information\ninfrastructure aims to facilitate the broad dissemination of research outputs of all types -\nincluding research data - to allow use, nullification , refinement and reuse. Creating a ubiquitous,\ncomprehensive and linked research data environment requires a seamless network of content,\ntechnologies, policies, expertise and practices. It is also critical to view this scholarly\norganization as an enterpr ise that needs to be maintained, improved, assessed and promoted\novertime.\nOpen access does not entirely remove fees and access limitations, but it replaces and\nreconfigures them for the key stakeholders in the scholarly communication endeavor. As we\nexplore a range of issues related to research data curation and management, it is prudent and\ntimely to consider how these services will be maintained and developed in order to flourish over\ntime. What we may consider an exploratory or pilot initiative often e nds up transitioning into\nproduction, sometimes with insufficient time to think through implications. Therefore as we\nenvision research data support, it is critical that we consider long -term development and\nmanagement issues upstream as a component of an enduring service infrastructure. Simply put,\nsustainability is the capacity to endure. For repositories, sustainability entails long -term\nmaintenance of responsibility, which has technical, socioeconomic, policy and business\ndimensions and encompasses the concept of stewardship, the responsible management of\nresource use. At the heart of the concept is the ability to secure resources such as technologies,\nexpertise, policies, visions and standards needed to protect and enhance the value of a service\nbased o n the needs of the user community technologies. In the pursuing discussion, based on\nCornell’s experience with arXiv, I highlight the key premises of sustainability.\nStarted in August 1991 by Paul Ginsparg, arXiv.org is inte rnationally acknowledged as a\npioneering digital archive and open -access distribution service for research articles. The e -print\nrepository, which moved to the Cornell University Library in 2001, has transformed the\nscholarly communication infrastructure o f multiple fields of physics and plays an increasingly\nprominent role in mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance and\nstatistics. As of August 2012, arXiv included over 770,000 e -prints. In 2011 there were 76,578\nnew submis sions and close to 50 million downloads from all over the world. arXiv’s operating\ncosts for 2012 are projected to be approximately $550,000, including six FTE staff, server\nmaintenance and networking.\nSince January 2010, Cornell University Library (CUL) has undertaken an effort to establish a\nsustainability model for arXiv. As a three -year interim strategy for 2010 -2012, CUL initially\nestablished a voluntary institutional contribution model and invited pledges from 200 libraries\nand research laboratories worldwide that represent arXiv's heaviest institutional users. Since\nscholars worldwide depend on the stable operation and continued development of arXiv, this\nstrategy aimed to reduce arXiv's dependence on a single institution, instead creating a broad -\nbased, community -supported resource. Keeping open access academic resources such as arXiv\nsustainable entails not only covering the associated operating costs but also continuing to\nenhance the resources’ value based on the needs of the full range of user co mmunities. Cornell’s\nsustainability initiative has striven to assess and strengthen arXiv’s technical, service, financial\nand policy infrastructure. One of the goals of the business planning initiative has been to engage\nthe institutions that benefit from arXiv to assist in defining the future of the service.\nThe arXiv membership model, which will be launched in 2013, is an outcome of the three -year\nplanning process and was facilitated with a planning grant from the Simons Foundation. The\nmodel is founded o n a set of operating principles for arXiv and presents a business model for\ngenerating revenues. The background information about the planning activities is available at\nhttp://arxiv.org/help/support . The busin ess model is composed of four sources of revenue:\nCornell’s annual funding of $75,000 per year and indirect expenses (represents 37% of direct\nexpenses), $50,000 per year gift from the Simons Foundation, annual fee income from the\nmember institutions and a $300,000 per year challenge grant from the Simons Foundation based\non the revenues generated through membership payments. The substantial gift from the Simons\nFoundation aims to encourage long -term community support by lowering arXiv membership\nfees, maki ng participation affordable to a broad range of institutions. Based on institutional\nusage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers within the $1,500 -3,000 range.",

    "text": "arXiv as a sociotechnical system consists of technical syst ems and standards - activities and\npractices involved in developing and using the system and the social arrangements and\norganizations that provide it with a structural framework. The sustainability planning process\naims not only to investigate how to dive rsify revenue models but also to ensure that arXiv strives\nto meet a set of operational, editorial, financial and governance principles and can set an example\nof a transparent and reliable community -supported service. Based on Cornell’s experience in\nplann ing the future of arXiv, the following discussion proposes five sustainability principles,\nincluding the consideration of disciplinary cultures, creation of a governance structure, stability\nof technological components, creation of content policies and adh erence to managerial best\npractices [ 1]\nDeep Integration into the Scholarly Community and Scholarly Processes . Disciplinary\ncharacteristics, work practices and conventions of a cademia play an important role in\nresearchers’ assessment and appropriation of information communication technologies.\nRepository deployment cannot be fully understood without comprehending how a specific\ntechnology is embedded in its social context. The i nformation and communication technology\nintegration characteristic of disciplinary communities often mirrors underlying differences in\nepistemic cultures. arXiv is a scholarly communication forum informed and guided by scientists\nand the scientific culture s being served. Through Paul Ginsparg’s leadership, which is rooted in\nboth the academic and information science communities, the service has consistently focused on\nthe disciplinary cultures represented in the digital repository and on community need [ 2]. arXiv’s\nwide international acceptance attests the importance of relying on user - and evidence -based\nstrategies for informing IT modifications and enhancements, user support se rvices and associated\nrepository policies.\nClearly Defined Mandate and Governance Structure . Although best practices in developing\ntechnical architectures and associated processes and policies underpin a digital repository,\norganizational attributes are eq ually important. The Trustworthy Repositories Audit &\nCertification: Criteria and Checklist (TRAC) tool ( http://trac.edgewall.org/ ) emphasizes that\norganizational attributes affect the performance, accountability a nd sustainability of repositories.\nThe first criteria in the TRAC assessment tool are governance and organizational viability.\nSimilarly, subject repositories must have clearly defined mandates and associated governance\nstructures to reflect a commitment t o the long -term stewardship of a service.\nThe general purpose of governance is to ensure that an organization has the means to envision its\nfuture and the management structures and processes in place to ensure that the plan is\nimplemented and sustained. Go od governance is participatory, consensus oriented, accountable,\ntransparent, responsive, efficient, equitable and inclusive. However, it also needs to be nimble\nand flexible - not allowing any gridlocks or excessive groupthink.\nThe key editorial, governa nce and economic tenets of arXiv are delineated by a set of principles\n(https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/xKSTBw ). CUL holds the overall administrative and financial\nresponsibility for arXiv’s operatio n and development, with strategic and operational guidance\nfrom its Member Advisory Board (MAB) and its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). CUL\nmanages the moderation of submissions and user support (including the development and\nimplementation of policies an d procedures), operates arXiv’s technical infrastructure, assumes\nresponsibility for archiving to ensure long -term access, oversees arXiv mirror sites and\nestablishes and maintains collaborations with related initiatives to improve services for the\nscienti fic community through interoperability and tool sharing. MAB is elected from arXiv’s\nmembership and advises CUL on issues related to repository management and development,\nstandards implementation, interoperability, development priorities, business plannin g and\nfinancial planning. SAB is composed of scientists and researchers in areas covered by arXiv and\nprovides advice and guidance pertaining to the intellectual oversight of arXiv, with particular\nfocus on the policies and operation of arXiv's moderation system.\nTechnology Platform Stability and Innovation . The existing repository ecology is a complex of\narchitectures and features that are optimized to fulfill the specific needs of institutional, subject\nor archival repositories. The landscape is becoming even more heterogeneous with the addition\nof scientific social networking sites that profile local scholarly activities and open data initiatives\nthat focus on data curation models. A critical component of a sustainability plan is to consider\nthis rich co ntext and understand how the service fits within the broader framework. In particular,\nwe need to factor in the following three aspects:\n Interoperability arrangements that link a given repository to related systems, services and",

    "text": " Functionality and arrangements that lower barriers to contributing content to multiple\ncomplementary repositories.\nAmong the cri tical roles of repositories is facilitating the preservation function. Digital\npreservation (used interchangeably with archiving ) refers to a range of managed activities to\nsupport the long -term maintenance of bitstreams, thereby ensuring that digital obje cts are usable.\nHowever, ensuring enduring access involves more than bitstream preservation. It must provide\ncontinued access to digital content through various delivery methods. As we assess the value of\nsubject repositories, it is important to differenti ate between bitstream preservation and preserving\naccess. Also, some subject repositories may opt to institute best practices for managing digital\ncontent but may not be in a position to assume full preservation responsibilities. It is therefore\ncritical t o assess the clearly defined roles and associated procedures that pertain to this\nresponsibility.\nThere is often an inherent tension between technological stability and innovation. Although\ndependability and consistency are important service attributes, also essential is keeping pace with\nevolving user needs through research and development (R&D) projects. Accordingly, assessing\nresource needs and planning for investments in staffing and equipment are challenging tasks on\nboth the maintenance and R&D fron ts. However, given the uncertainties associated with the\ndevelopment and testing of new features and services, an innovation agenda needs to be carefully\nthought out in order to ensure that operational stability is not undermined.\nThe sustainability of ar Xiv also depends on enabling interoperability and creating efficiencies\namong repositories with related and complementary content to reduce duplication of efforts. For\ninstance, Cornell has collaborated with the NSF Data Conservancy project\n(http://dataconservancy.org/ ) to launch a pilot interface that allows arXiv submitters to upload\ndata associated with their articles directly to the Data Conservancy repository. Links to the data\nare added in the arXiv record a utomatically. This service is a research project, however, and\narXiv and the Data Conservancy make no guarantee about continued availability of datasets\nuploaded via this mechanism past the end of 2011.\nSystematic Development of Content Policies . Content curation and stewardship roles have\ntraditionally been shared by libraries and publishers - publishers with a focus on creation and\ndistribution and libraries specializing in discovery and preservation. In digital information\nenvironments, repository servi ces such as arXiv blur the distinction between libraries and\npublishers. An essential criterion in assessing open access, online resources is the availability of\nclearly defined collection policies and submission guidelines that reflect the content curatio n and\nstewardship role of the hosting institution.\nAlthough arXiv is not peer -reviewed, submissions are reviewed by subject -based moderators.\nAdditionally, an endorsement system is in place to ensure that content is relevant to current\nresearch in the spe cified disciplines. It is also critical to have clearly articulated policies about\nthe copyright status of the deposited materials as well as conflict management processes (such as\nresponding to concerns in regard to rejected submissions). arXiv supplement s the traditional\npublication system by providing immediate dissemination and open access to scholarly articles\n(which often appear later in conventional journals).\narXiv complements, rather than competes with, the commercial and scholarly society journal\npublishing market. Among the challenges are ensuring the authority and integrity of e -prints and\ndistinguishing between succeeding versions, such as a pre -print paper and its published version\nin a scholarly journal. It is therefore critical that the repo sitory and preservation community\naddress the versioning of scholarly articles, tracking them from initial submission to pre -print\narchive to final publication in a formal scholarly journal. Other challenges include linking the\nburgeoning corpus of institu tional repositories with related subject repositories in order to\nachieve version control as well as creating a critical mass of related materials on particular\ntopics. Cornell’s participation in the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) author\nidenti fiers initiative ( http://www.orcid.org ) aims to enable better author linking and allow\nimprovements in ownership claiming.\nReliance on Business Planning Strategies . Business plans offer an overall view of a given\nproduc t and its relevant user segments, key stakeholders, communication channels,\ncompetencies, resources, networks, collaborations, cost structures and revenue models. The\nprimary purpose of a business planning process is to convey a clear value proposition to justify\ninvestment in a service or product by its potential users. The value proposition describes the\nbenefits that a product or service provides. In other words, value propositions respond to this\nquestion: Why should an institution purchase your product or service? Since the focus of the\nvalue proposition is on the customer, it should be stated from the end -users’ perspective. Value\npropositions may be based on a range of characteristics such as service features, customer\nsupport, product customization a nd economical pricing. The key challenge in creating a value\nproposition is addressing the needs of all stakeholders. For instance, in the case of arXiv, the\nstakeholders include scientists, libraries, research centers, societies, publishers and funding\nagencies. Although they are likely to have common goals, each group attaches value to a specific\naspect of arXiv. For instance, from the end -users’ perspective, scientists’ highest priority for\narXiv is likely to be the robustness and reliability of the repo sitory and access features.\nBusiness models also convey financial plans. In a collaborative business model such as the arXiv\nMembership Model it is critical to clearly define and justify the pricing model and the budget to\nunderstand how revenues are bein g generated and spent. Maintaining, supporting and further\ndeveloping a repository involve a range of expenses including management, programming,\nsystem administration, curation, storage, hardware, facilities (space, furniture, networking,\nphone), research and training (such as attending meetings and conferences), outreach and\npromotion, user documentation and administrative support.",

    "text": "EVSO: Environment-aware Video Streaming\nEmail:fkyoungjun, mckg@kaist.ac.kr\nAbstract -Streaming services gradually support high-quality\nvideos for the better user experience. However, streaming highquality video on mobile devices consumes a considerable amount\nof energy. This paper presents the design and prototype of EVSO,\nwhich achieves power saving by applying adaptive frame rates to\nparts of videos with a little degradation of the user experience.\nEVSO utilizes a novel perceptual similarity measurement method\nbased on human visual perception specialized for a video encoder.\nWe also extend the media presentation description, in which the\nvideo content is selected based only on the network bandwidth,\nto allow for additional consideration of the user’s battery status.\nEVSO’s streaming server preprocesses the video into several\nprocessed videos according to the similarity intensity of each\npart of the video and then provides the client with the processed\nvideo suitable for the network bandwidth and the battery\nstatus of the client’s mobile device. The EVSO system was\nimplemented on the commonly used H.264/A VC encoder. We\nconduct various experiments and a user study with nine videos.\nOur experimental results show that EVSO effectively reduces the\nenergy consumption when mobile devices uses streaming services\nby 22% on average and up to 27% while maintaining the quality\nof the user experience.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nVideo streaming on mobile devices such as smartphones\nand tablets has seen unprecedented growth in recent years.\nAccording to [1], mobile video trafﬁc accounted for more than\n60% of the total mobile trafﬁc in 2017, and it is expected to\ngrow by 54% annually, reaching 78% of all trafﬁc by 2021.\nCurrently, many video streaming services and smartphones\nsupport high frame rates and high resolutions for better user\nexperiences [2], [3]. In addition, both Virtual Reality (VR) and\nAugmented Reality (AR) that require high-quality video are\nconsidered to be among the next big applications in mobile\ntechnology. However, high-quality videos require a signiﬁcant\nproportion of device resources, mainly display-related components, resulting in much higher power consumption [4], [5].\nMany mobile device manufacturers have put in much effort\nto increase the battery lifetime of mobile devices. According\nto Samsung, the battery capacity of their smartphones has\nexperienced a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of\n11.17% from 2010 to present indicating that the battery\ncapacity has steadily improved [3]. However, since the amount\nof mobile video trafﬁc will increase by 54% yearly, the current\nrate of improvement in the battery capacity will not meet the\npower consumption requirement of video streaming in the near\nfuture.There have been several efforts to reduce the power consumption of mobile games, which typically have high frame\nrates and resolutions causing the rapid battery drain. One\napproach called Game Tuner [6] allows users to conﬁgure\nparameters related to frame rates or resolutions. However, the\ndisadvantages of this approach are that the user experience\nis seriously degraded due to the static conﬁguration and that\nthe user intervention is required. To solve these problems,\nthere have been several approaches that attempt to dynamically\nscale frame rates based on the frame contents [5], [7]. This\nis achieved by measuring the structural similarity between\nframes and then dropping redundant or very similar frames.\nHowever, these approaches only drop frames on the client\nside; hence, the number of frames transmitted to the client\nis not affected. Therefore, the energy consumption required\nfor wireless transmission on the client side remains the same.\nIn addition, the network bandwidth on the client side is not\nutilized efﬁciently because unnecessary frames are transmitted.\nBased on the aforementioned discussion, we propose\nEnvironment-aware Video Streaming Optimization (EVSO),\nwhich effectively applies adaptive frame rates for videos\nwithout requiring any user effort or incurring considerable\ncomputational overhead. The environment represents the status\nof the user’s mobile device and the characteristics of the\nvideo that the streaming server delivers to the user. The basic\nidea behind EVSO is that not all parts of the video require\nhigh frame rates. In other words, adaptive frame rates can be\napplied to parts of the video according to the degree of motion\nchange between frames. For example, in a video where a golfer\nprepares for a swing, a lower frame rate can be applied due\nto the low variation in the frames [8]. On the other hand, a\nhigher frame rate can be applied to the high variation in the\nframes such as a swing in motion or a moving golf ball to\navoid a degradation of the user experience.\nEVSO utilizes a H.264/A VC encoder [9], which is the most\nwidely used video encoder, to be interoperable with existing\nsystems without additional deployment overhead. EVSO includes the Frame rate Scheduler (F-Scheduler), which scales\nthe frame rates of speciﬁc parts of videos using a perceptionaware analysis based on the information generated during the\nH.264/A VC encoding process. We note that the H.264/A VC\nencoder calculates the similarity between frames based on\nmacroblocks during the video compression (or video coding)\nprocess. EVSO utilizes these macroblocks to schedule differ-arXiv:1905.06500v1 [cs.MM] 16 May 2019\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\nFrame Number [1, N-1]00.20.40.60.81SSIM (fN, fN+1)Figure 1: Variation of SSIM between adjacent frames in the baseball video.\nent parts of the video with appropriate frame rates.\nThe EVSO system was implemented on a video streaming\nserver built with Internet Information Services (IIS) [10].\nWe conducted a broad range of experiments and a user\nstudy with nine videos to evaluate the proposed system. Our\nexperimental results show that EVSO can greatly reduce the\nenergy requirement with little impact on the user experience.\nThe system reduced the energy consumption rate by an average\nof 22% and up to 27%. In addition, the user study shows that\nusers cannot clearly distinguish between the original videos\nand videos processed through EVSO.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u000fWe propose a new perceptual similarity calculation\nmethod that leverages the information generated by the\nH.264/A VC encoding process.\n\u000fBased on the similarity calculation method, we present\na novel scheduling technique that adaptively adjusts the\nframe rate according to the degree of motion intensity.\n\u000fWe extend the media presentation description (MPD) to\ntake into account not only network conditions but also\nbattery status.\n\u000fWe present the design and prototype of the EVSO system\nto reduce energy consumption when streaming videos.\n\u000fVarious experiments and a user study show that the\nproposed system effectively preserves the user experience\nvideos.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II\nexplains the motivation behind EVSO. Section III describes\nthe design of EVSO and its main functions. Section IV\npresents the detailed implementation of EVSO and Section V\nreports the various experiments and a user study. Section VI\nintroduces the related work and Section VII concludes the\nstudy and discusses possible future work.\nII. M OTIVATION AND BACKGROUND\nThis section highlights the necessity of EVSO and explains\nthe information leveraged by EVSO during the H.264/A VC\nencoding process.\nA. Similarity Analysis of Adjacent Video Frames\nThe similarity between frames can be measured using the\nStructural SIMilarity (SSIM) index [11]. Figure 1 shows SSIM\nindices between adjacent frames in a baseball video [8]. The\nrange of the SSIM index is from 0 to 1, and a value of 0.9\nor higher is considered to indicate a strong similarity between\ntwo frames [12]. The red shaded mark in Figure 1 indicates\nthat the SSIM value between adjacent frames is higher than\nFrame N Frame N+24 Frame N+48\n(Average SSIM: 90.75% )\n(Average SSIM: 30.75% )Figure 2: Degree of frame change during fast and slow movements.\n0.9, which means that the degree of change is fairly low. For\nexample, Figure 2 shows examples of a slow movement where\nthe pitcher prepares to throw the ball and a fast movement\nwhere the ball is thrown and the camera quickly follows the\nball. The difference between the average values of SSIM for\nthe two movement scenarios is 60%, which is a large gap. This\nindicates that the degree of change can vary greatly according\nto which part of the video is playing, even within in a single\nvideo. Therefore, the energy consumption requirement can be\nreduced by throttling down the frame rate during slow moving\nparts.\nB. Video Upload Process and H.264/AVC Encoder\nWhen a user uploads a video to a streaming media service\nsuch as YouTube, the server transcodes the video into a\nset of optimized video streams. Transcoding is a conversion\nprocess in which the encoding settings of the original video\nare reformatted. There are several reasons why the streaming\nserver must perform transcoding when the video is uploaded.\nThe ﬁrst case is when the streaming server needs to lower\nthe bitrate of the uploaded video, which is called transrating .\nThe second case is when the streaming server needs to lower\nthe resolution of the uploaded video, known as transsizing .\nThe transrating and transsizing are always performed when\nthe server creates several processed videos to provide DASH\nfunctionality [13].\nThe most commonly used video codec for streaming servers\nis H.264/A VC [2]. Therefore, when transcoding is performed\non a streaming server, the H.264/A VC encoder is used to\nconvert the original video into the desired videos. The video\nencoding of H.264/A VC follows a block-based approach where\neach coded picture is represented by block-shaped units called\nmacroblocks. A macroblock consists of four 8 \u00028 luminance\n(Y) samples and two 8 \u00028 chrominance (Cb and Cr) samples\nin the YCbCr color space with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling [9].\nThese Y samples are extracted and utilized in EVSO because\nthe human visual system is sensitive to luminance [14].\nIII. EVSO D ESIGN\nFigure 3 shows the EVSO system, which consists of\nthree major components: Frame rate Scheduler (F-Scheduler),\nVideo Processor (V-Processor), and Extended MPD (EMPD).\nWhen a video is uploaded to a streaming server, F-Scheduler\ncalculates the perceptual similarity score between adjacent\nframes with little computational overhead (see Section III-A).\nThen, F-Scheduler determines how to split the video into\nTransformEncodeH.264/MPEG -4 AVC Encoder\nF-Scheduler\n< Sec 3.1 -3.3 >V-Processor\n< Sec 4 >EMPD\n< Sec 3.4 >\nMacroblock’s Y(luminance) values DecoderEVSO\n1080p\n720p\n480pMPDFigure 3: Flow of EVSO when a video is uploaded to a streaming server.\nmultiple video chunks with similar motion intensity levels\n(see Section III-B) and schedules the appropriate frame rates\nfor each video chunk according to three battery levels: High,\nMedium, and Low (see Section III-C). Although our study\nadopts three battery levels, other settings can also be applied.\nThe scheduling results generated from F-Scheduler specify\nwhich frame rate is appropriate for each part of the video. Afterwards, V-Processor processes the original video according\nto what is speciﬁed in the scheduling results to produce videos\nsuitable for the three battery levels. Detailed implementation\nof V-Processor is described in Section IV. Finally, EMPD\nallows users to request appropriate video chunks, taking into\nconsideration not only the network condition but also the\nbattery status (see Section III-D).\nNote that this paper focuses on H.264/A VC as the video\ncodec; however, we emphasize that the proposed EVSO system is not limited solely to H.264/A VC. Since other codecs\nalso perform video compression using the luminance (Y)\nvalues of the macroblock in the similar manner as H.264/A VC,\nEVSO can easily be applied to other codecs.\nA. Calculating the Perceptual Similarity Score\nThe human vision system is more sensitive to changes in\nthe brightness (Y) than it is to changes in colors (Cb and Cr)\n(or Y-Diff) reﬂects the changes in visual perception fairly well.\nMoreover, they found Y-Diff to be highly correlated with the\ncommonly used SSIM method through various experiments\nand a user study. However, human vision is sensitive not\nonly to brightness but also to object movement [15]. The\nY-Diff value between two images is calculated as the Sum\nof Absolute Differences (SAD) of the luminance values on\na per-frame basis, not on a per-block basis. Therefore, the\nlocal information can be ignored because the detailed features\nof each block are mixed. In other words, Y-Diff effectively\nreﬂects the brightness but can be less accurate to the motion\nperception of objects. Although Y-Diff can partially reﬂect\nsome perception of object movement [14], but more attention\nneeds to be paid to motion information in order to be more\ncompatible with human perception.\nTo effectively calculate the perceptual similarity scores by\nconsidering both the brightness and object movement in video\nstreaming environments, we deﬁne the Macroblock-Difference\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\nY-Diff (fN, fN+1) 10800.20.40.60.81SSIM (fN, fN+1)Figure 4: Correlation between Y-Diff and SSIM (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient: -0.7329).\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\nM-Diff (fN, fN+1) 10400.20.40.60.81SSIM (fN, fN+1)\nFigure 5: Correlation between M-Diff and SSIM (Pearson’s correlation\ncoefﬁcient: -0.7834).\n(or M-Diff), DMB (fa;fb), between frames faandfbas\nfollows:\nDMB(fa;fb) =N\u00001X\ni=0M\u00001X\nj=0DY(fa(i;j);fb(i;j)) (1)\nDY(fa(i;j);fb(i;j)) =(\n1; SAD Y(fa(i;j);fb(i;j))>\u0012\n0; SAD Y(fa(i;j);fb(i;j))\u0014\u0012(2)\nwherefk(i;j)is thek-th frame of N\u0002Mmacroblocks\nwithiandjrepresenting the macroblock coordinates;\nSAD Y(fa(i;j);fb(i;j))is the SAD value between the luminance value of fa(i;j)andfb(i;j); andDY(fa(i;j);fb(i;j))\nis set to one when the SAD value between the luminance value\noffa(i;j)andfb(i;j)exceeds a certain threshold \u0012. The value\nof\u0012is set to 320 because OpenH264 [16] determines high\nmotion blocks when the SAD value of the luminance exceeds\n320 when detecting a scene change. Finding the optimal value\nof\u0012is left as future work.\nEVSO used M-Diff as a perceptual similarity measurement\nmethod to cover both brightness and object movement. MDiff uses the luminance values of macroblocks to perform\nbrightness perception and handles object movement through\nblock-based calculation. The block-based approach performs\nthe perceptual similarity calculation based on the macroblock\nunit rather than on the frame unit. Figure 4 shows how YDiff is similar to SSIM in the analysis on adjacent frames of\nseven videos [8], and Figure 5 shows how M-Diff is similar to\nSSIM in the same videos. These ﬁgures indicate that M-Diff\nis highly correlated with SSIM, which is approximately 5%\nhigher than Y-Diff. In other words, M-Diff has an accuracy\ncomparable to or better than Y-Diff in perceptual similarity\ncalculation.\nHow about using SSIM as a method for the perceptual\nsimilarity calculation: More than 72 hours of new video\ncontent is uploaded to YouTube every minute, and the volume\nof uploaded videos continues to grow [17]. For such a large\nnumber of videos, performing SSIM calculations for consecutive frames is exorbitant in terms of computational time and\npower. On a desktop PC equipped with a 3.5 GHz processor\nand 12 GB of memory, it took about 401 milliseconds to\ncalculate the perceptual similarity between two frames with\n1920\u00021080 resolution using SSIM. If SSIM is used to process\na video with 60 frames per second for a duration of 30 minutes,\nthe time overhead is approximately 12 hours. On the other\nhand, there is little or no overhead incurred in the M-Diff\ncalculation because it uses the luminance differences between\nmacroblocks generated by the H.264/A VC encoder when a\nvideo is uploaded.\nB. Splitting Video into Multiple Video Chunks\nIn order to apply multiple frame rates to a single video, how\nto properly split the video into multiple chunks needs to be\nconsidered. If a video is split too ﬁnely, an appropriate frame\nrate can be set to suit the characteristics of each video chunk,\nbut it takes a very long time to process the video. In contrast,\nif a video is split too coarsely, it is difﬁcult to calculate the\nappropriate frame rate because the characteristic of each video\nchunk becomes ambiguous, which can adversely impact the\nuser experience.\nEstimating the split threshold: A simple approach to splitting\nthe video is to use the M-Diff value in the perceptual similarity\nscore as a separation criterion. For example, if more than 80%\nof the corresponding macroblocks in two frames exceed the\nthreshold\u0012, then there is a large enough difference between the\ntwo frames and thus they can be separated. Another approach\nis to use the local statistical properties of the frame sequence to\ndeﬁne a dynamic threshold model. These local properties can\ninclude mean and standard deviation to determine the degree\nof change in the frame sequence. However, the above two\napproaches are used mainly to detect scene changes [16]. On\nthe other hand, our approach is to design separation criteria\nthat allow each video chunk to have a similar degree of\nvariability.\nWe newly deﬁne the Estimated Split Threshold (EST) to\nseparate the video into multiple chunks with similar variability\nlevels, as follows:\nEST (fn) =(\n1;if(\u001bn>\u000b orDMB(fn\u00001;fn)>\f)andT >\n0; otherwise(3)\n\u001bn=vuut1\nK\u00001n\u00001X\ni=n\u0000K+1(DMB(fi;fi+1)\u0000mn)2 (4)\nmn=1\nKn\u00001X\ni=n\u0000K+1DMB(fi;fi+1) (5)\nwheremnis the average M-Diff value of the previous K\nnumber of frames; \u001bnis the standard deviation with the\nwindow size Krepresenting the degree of M-Diff scattering\nof the previous Knumber of frames; and EST (fn)is a\nthreshold that determines whether to split. When the value of\nEST (fn)is one, EVSO decides to split at fn. InEST (fn),\nDMB (fn\u00001;fn)is used to detect clear scene changes. Finally,\nTis the number of frames in the current video chunk and\nis the frame rate of the current video. The values of \u001bnand\n1000 2000 3000 4000\nFactor050100150Processing Time (s)(a) Constant factor\n0.5 1 1.5 2\nFactor 104050100Processing Time (s) (b) Constant factor\nFigure 6: Variation of the processing time according to the constant factors.\nDMB (fn\u00001;fn)tend to be large around the high-motion part\nof the video, which can cause the video to split too ﬁnely.\nTherefore, the inequality N > \r representing the minimum\ncondition is applied so that each video chunk is at least one\nsecond long.\nDetermining the \u000b,\f, andKfactors: The smaller the value\nof the constant factors \u000band\f, the less frames are assigned\nto the video chunk, so each video chunk can have a more\nsimilar level of variability. In the extreme, setting \u000band\fto\n0 can be effective for the user experience; however, if \u000band\nare too low, the number of separated video chunks and the\nprocessing time of V-Processor increase exponentially. That\nis,\u000band\fshould be appropriately selected in consideration\nof the tradeoff between the computational complexity and the\naccuracy of the frame rate estimation process.\nFigure 6(a) shows the processing time when \u000bis set to\n1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 with nine experimental videos on\na server equipped with 2.20 GHz \u000240 processors and 135 GB\nof memory. As \u000bincreases, the total number of video chunks\nto be separated decreases reducing the overall processing time.\nOur ﬁndings indicate that in most videos, the processing time\ndecreases drastically when \u000bis set to 3000, after which it\nremains nearly the same. Likewise, Figure 6(b) shows that\nthe processing time decreases as \fincreases. Moreover, in\nmost of the videos, the processing time decreases sharply\nuntil\freaches 15000 and then remains almost the same.\nConsequently, \u000band\fare set to 3000 and 15000, respectively,\nto allow efﬁcient processing.\nIf the window size Kis set too high, rapid motion changes\ncannot be detected as separation criteria. Kvalues of 1, 5,\n10, and 30 were tested to determine the appropriate value for\ndetecting motion changes in our experimental environment.\nBased on numerous experiments, Kis set to 10. The optimal\nvalue of the window size Kdepends on the characteristic of\nthe video being processed.\nC. Estimating Frame Rates for Video Chunks\nAfter splitting the video into multiple video chunks based on\nthe discussion presented in Section III-B, an appropriate frame\nrate needs to be determined for each video chunk. Setting the\nproper frame rate to match the variation of each video chunk\nis a crucial step in terms of the user experience.\nEstimating proper frame rates for video chunks: Based on\nthe analysis of the relationship between the M-Diff values and\nframe rates, we deﬁne the Estimated Proper Frame rate (EPF)\nPeriod 2Adaptation Set 1Representation 4\n# Period 1\nduration = “PT30S”...\n# Period 2duration = “PT5M”...\n# Period 3duration = “PT7M”...\n...# Adaptation Set 0\n# Adaptation Set 1\n# Adaptation Set 2# Representation 11080p, HighmimeType = “video/mp4”\n...# Representation 4720p, HighmimeType = “video/mp4”\n...\n# Representation 21080p, MediummimeType = “video/mp4”\n...# Representation 5720p, MediummimeType = “video/mp4”\n...\n# Representation 31080p, LowmimeType = “video/mp4”\n...# Representation 6720p, LowmimeType = “video/mp4”\n...Initialization segment ( URL)\nMIT_course_1280x720_5000k_high _dashinit.mp4\nRepresentation 6Media Segment 1\n(URL)\n......\nInitialization segment ( URL)\nMIT_course_1280x720_5000k_low_dashinit.mp4...\n...\n...Media Segment 2\n(URL)Media Segment 3\n(URL)\nMedia Segment 1\n(URL)Media Segment 2\n(URL)Media Segment 3\n(URL)...Figure 7: The overall hierarchical structure of EMPD.\nas follows:\nEPF (fn;fn+1) =8\n>>>>><\n>>>>>:s1\u0002\r ifDMB(fn;fn+1)<\u001c1\ns2\u0002\r if\u001c1\u0014DMB(fn;fn+1)<\u001c2\ns3\u0002\r if\u001c2\u0014DMB(fn;fn+1)<\u001c3\ns4\u0002\r if\u001c3\u0014DMB(fn;fn+1)<\u001c4\ns5\u0002\r if\u001c4\u0014DMB(fn;fn+1)(6)\nwheres1,s2,s3,s4, ands5are the scaling factors of the frame\nrate\rthat match the degree of change between fnandfn+1;\nand\u001c1,\u001c2,\u001c3, and\u001c4are the scaling thresholds that distinguish\nM-Diff values based on similar variations. EPF (fn;fn+1)is\nutilized to calculate the appropriate frame rate for adjacent\nframes, and then we deﬁne the Estimated Video chunk Frame\nrate (EVF) to obtain the appropriate frame rate for each video\nchunk as follows:\nEVF (Sk) =m\u00001X\ni=lEPF (fi;fi+1)\nm\u0000l+\u000e\u0002\u001bSk(7)\nwhereSkrepresents the k-th video chunk, i.e.,\n(fl;fl+1;fl+2;:::;f m), which is needed to estimate the\nappropriate frame rate; and \u001bSkis the standard deviation of\nadjacent frames in Skbased on Equation (4), which is used to\ndetermine whether the degree of M-Diff variation in the video\nchunk is constant or anomalous. If \u001bSkis high, it means that\nfast and slow moving parts coexist in a single video chunk. In\nthis case, the overall frame rate can be adjusted to take into\naccount the highly variable parts for a better user experience.\nOur experiments were performed with \u000eequal to 0.0001, but\nit can be tailored to the speciﬁc environment in which EVSO\nis deployed.\nDetermining \u001candsfactors: To determine the \u001cfactors, we\nanalyzed the relationship between M-Diff and the commonly\nused SSIM using a linear regression based on Figure 5. The\nresulting equation is as follows:\nSSIM (fn;fn+1) = 1:0063\u00001:5903\u000210\u00005\u0002DMB(fn;fn+1):(8)\nThe statistical values of R2(R-squared) and Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient (PCC) were calculated to measure the\ngoodness of ﬁt. The R2and PCC values of this regression\nmodel are 0.613 and -0.7834, respectively, indicating that the\ncorrelation between SSIM and M-Diff is sufﬁciently high.If the SSIM index between two frames is above 0.9, the\npeak signal-to-noise ratio is above 50 dB and the mean opinion\nscore, which represents the quality of experience on a scale\nof 1 to 5, corresponds to 4 (Good) or 5 (Excellent, Identical)\n0.98, 0.95, and 0.91. According to the regression model in\nEquation (8), the M-Diff values corresponding to these SSIM\nindices are 500, 1500, 3000, and 6000, and these values\nrepresent\u001c1,\u001c2,\u001c3, and\u001c4in Equation (6), respectively.\nThesfactors are set differently depending on the battery\nlevel. Detailed settings of the sfactors are described in\nSection V.\nD. Extending Media Presentation Description (MPD) for\nDynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) [13],\nalso known as MPEG-DASH, is an adaptive bitrate streaming\ntechnology that allows a multimedia ﬁle to be partitioned into\nseveral segments and transmitted to the client over HTTP. In\nother words, when a video is uploaded, the streaming server\nmust generate several processed videos by adjusting the bitrate\nand resolution to provide DASH functionality.\nMedia Presentation Description (MPD) refers to a manifest\nthat provides segment information such as resolutions, bitrates,\nand URLs of the video contents. Therefore, the DASH client\nchooses the segment with the highest possible resolution and\nbitrate that can be supported by the network bandwidth and\nthen fetches the corresponding segment through MPD. EVSO\nextends MPD to allow the client to select segments considering\nthe battery status as well as the network bandwidth.\nFigure 7 shows the hierarchical structure of Extended MPD\n(EMPD), which consists of one or more periods that describe\nthe content duration. Multiple periods can be used when it is\nnecessary to classify multiple videos into chapter-by-chapter\nor separate advertisements and contents. Each period consists\nof one or more adaptation sets , which include media streams.\nThe period typically consists of separate adaptation sets of\naudio and video for efﬁcient bandwidth management. The\nadaptation set of the video consists of several representations\nthat contain speciﬁc information about alternative contents,\nsuch as the resolution and MIME type (or content type).\nEMPD extended this adaptation set to include an EVSOLevel\nattribute, allowing the client to select the representation that\nis appropriate for their current battery situation.

I MPLEMENTATION\nIn order to study the effectiveness of EVSO, we implemented a video streaming server with DASH functionality\nusing IIS [10]. The video streaming server sends EMPD to\nthe client to allow the users to select the appropriate video.\nWe also implemented a video streaming client by modifying\nExoPlayer [18], which is an open-source media player for\nAndroid, to interpret the EMPD manifest information taking\ninto account the battery status and network bandwidth.\nFrame rate Scheduler (F-Scheduler): The source code for\nOpenH264 [16] was modiﬁed to determine which frame rate\nis appropriate for each video chunk. The SAD values of\nthe macroblocks are extracted when the H.264/A VC encoder\nperforms the video compression process. These extracted SAD\nvalues of the macroblocks are utilized to analyze the motion\nvariation of the video and to set the appropriate frame rates\naccordingly.\nVideo Processor (V-Processor): After the streaming server\nprocesses the uploaded video to generate videos with various\nresolutions and bitrates for the DASH service, V-Processor\nadditionally processes the videos according to the schedule\nprovided by F-Scheduler. This is achieved using the seeking\nandconcatenate methods of FFmpeg [19] to generate videos\nwith adaptive frame rates. The seeking method is used to split\nthe video into multiple video chunks, and the frame rate of\neach video chunk is adjusted to match the schedule. Finally,\nthe video chunks that have different frame rates are combined\ninto a single video through the concatenate method.\nNote that V-Processor is integrated into the H.264/A VC\nencoder for performance reasons. The implementation location\nof V-Processor can be changed depending on the deployment\nsituation.\nV.

As shown in Table I,\nthese videos have various frame rates and resolutions in order\nto represent an environment similar to an actual streaming\nservice. In addition, the videos are grouped into three types\naccording to the degree of motion intensity: (A) Static, (B)\nDynamic, and (C) Hybrid groups. The static group consists of\nvideos that display almost identical scenes, such as lectures.\nThe dynamic group consists of videos with a high level of\nmotion intensity, such as sports. The hybrid group consists\nof videos that have both attributes of the two aforementioned\ngroups. Unless otherwise noted, we conducted experiments on\nthe videos processed to play for up to three minutes.\nFour different settings used for experiments (EVSO,\nEVSO+, EVSO++, 2/3 FPS): We conﬁgured EPF with three\ndifferent settings according to the user’s battery status, i.e.,\nEVSO, EVSO+, and EVSO++. The worse the battery condition, the more aggressive EVSO is used (denoted by more +\nsigns), allowing for a longer battery lifetime. For this reason,\nthrough multiple experiments, the values of s1,s2,s3,s4, and\ns5in Equation (6) are set to 0.6, 0.83, 0.9, 0.93, and 1 for\nEVSO, 0.5, 0.73, 0.83, 0.9, and 1 for EVSO+, 0.43, 0.6, 0.7,\n0.8, and 0.93 for EVSO++, respectively. As a comparison, we\nalso created an experimental group called 2/3 FPS that naively\nreduces the frame rate of the original video to two-thirds.\nVideos processed through EVSO: Table II shows the average\nframe rates of the videos processed according to battery levels.\nSince EVSO adaptively reduces the frame rate in consideration\nof the characteristics of the video, the resulting frame rate is\nquite different for each video. For example, the MIT video has\nlittle change in motion and is therefore reduced by more than\none-third of the original frame rate on EVSO. On the other\nhand, the Geographic video has a relatively fast-changing\nmotion, so EVSO reduces the frame rate of the video to only\nabout ﬁve-sixths of the original frame rate.\nA. Video Quality Assessment\nWe used three objective quality metrics to measure how\nmuch EVSO affected the quality of the videos: SSIM [11],\nVideo Quality Metric (VQM) [20], and Video Multimethod\nAssessment Fusion (VMAF) [21].

These metrics are more suited to measuring\nthe subjective quality of the video than SSIM. A low value of\nVQM indicates a high quality video. On the other hand, the\nVMAF index has a range from 0 to 1, and a high value of\nVMAF indicates a high quality video.\nTable III shows the quality of the videos processed through\nEVSO compared to 2/3 FPS. As can be seen, EVSO provides\nbetter overall video quality than 2/3 FPS in all video cases. For\nthe static group, both 2/3 FPS and EVSO maintain high quality\nbecause the motion intensity in the videos is comparatively\nlow. The most prominent gap between EVSO and 2/3 FPS\noccurs in the dynamic group, where 2/3 FPS causes the VMAF\nmetric to be less than 90% indicating a severe degradation\nof the user experience. In addition, in the Kershaw video,\nthe average frame rates of EVSO++ and 2/3 FPS are similar\nat 21.66 and 20, respectively, whereas the VMAF metric of\nEVSO++ is measured to be 5% higher than 2/3 FPS. This is\nbecause EVSO adjusts the frame rate by analyzing each part\nof the video so that the video quality can be kept much higher\nthan 2/3 FPS, which naively reduces the frame rate.\nB. Energy Saving\nWe used a Monsoon Power Monitor [22] to measure the\nenergy consumption of processed videos on a LG Nexus 5.\nThe brightness of the smartphone was conﬁgured to 30%,\nand the airplane mode was activated to reduce the effect from\nexternal variables, and Wi-Fi turned on to stream videos from\nthe streaming server. To prevent thermal throttling caused by\noverheating, the temperature of the smartphone was cooled\nbefore each experiment.\nWe evaluated the energy consumption of nine videos in\nfour different settings: Baseline, EVSO, EVSO++, and 2/3\nFPS. Baseline is an original video and serves as a controlgroup. EVSO, EVSO++, and 2/3 FPS use the same settings\nas described above. For accurate experiments, the energy\nconsumption of each video was measured ﬁve times and then\naveraged.\nFigure 8 shows the ratio of energy savings when comparing\nBaseline to EVSO, EVSO++, and 2/3 FPS. Because EVSO\nadjusts the frame rate according to the motion intensity, the\namount of energy saved varies considerably depending on the\nvideo characteristics. For example, the energy used by the\nMIT video in EVSO was reduced by about 27%, but for the\nTennis video, the reduction was only about 11%. However,\nif the current battery status is bad, EVSO++ can be used\nto reduce the energy requirement similarly to the 2/3 FPS\ngroup, except for the PyeongChang video, with a reduction\non average of 22% compared to Baseline.\nC. User Study\nTo analyze how the videos processed through EVSO affect\nthe user experience, we recruited 15 participants (10 males) for\nthe user study. We adopted the Double Stimulus Impairment\nScale (DSIS) and the Double Stimulus Continuous Quality\nScale (DSCQS), which are widely used for subjective quality\nassessments of systems [5], [7]. For the sake of experimentation, participants were allowed to watch one minute per video.\nDSIS: DSIS allows the participants to sequentially view two\nstimuli, i.e., the source video and the processed video, to\nassess the degree of impairment to the processed video. The\nevaluation index of DSIS is a ﬁve-point impairment scale\nof two stimuli: imperceptible (5 points), perceptible, but not\nannoying (4 points), slightly annoying (3 points), annoying (2\npoints), and very annoying (1 points). In DSIS, the participants\nare informed about which videos were original or processed.\nWe measured how much impairment occurred on the videos\nprocessed through EVSO. The participants were asked to\nNBC PyeongChang Geographic012345Rating (1~5)(a) Quality rating from DSIS\nNBC PyeongChang Geographic20406080100Rating (1~100)Baseline\nEVSO++\n2/3 FPS (b) Quality rating from DSCQS\nBaseline EVSO EVSO++ 2/3 FPS20406080100Rating (1~100) (c) Quality rating distribution from DSCQS\nFigure 9: Results of the user study through DSIS and DSCQS.\nwatch three video types: NBC (Static), PyeongChang (Dynamic), and Geographic (Hybrid). The participants were\ninformed in advance of which videos were processed, and\nthey saw the original video and then the processed video in\nsequence.\nFigure 9(a) shows the impairment rating of the videos. Most\nparticipants scored the processed videos as either ”imperceptible” or ”perceptible, but not annoying”. This indicates that\nmost participants did not recognize the difference between the\noriginal video and the processed video. In addition, the fact\nthat all three different types of the video received high scores\nindicates that EVSO properly considers the motion intensity\ncharacteristics of the videos.\nDSCQS: DSCQS allows the participants to view two stimuli,\ni.e., the source video and the processed video, in random order\nto evaluate the differences in perceived visual quality. The\nevaluation index of DSCQS is a [0-100] scale for each stimulus. Unlike DSIS, DSCQS does not inform the participants\nabout the setting of each video.\nThe participants were asked to watch the same three videos\nas in the DSIS method. For each video, the participants\nwatched the videos using four different settings in random\norder and evaluated the quality of each video. The participants\nwere allowed to watch the previously viewed videos again\nif they wanted. Figures 9(b) and (c) show the quality rating\nand quality rating distribution using DSCQS. The participants\ncould not distinguish between the original video (i.e., Baseline)\nand the processed video (i.e., EVSO). On the other hand, the\nparticipants were able to clearly discriminate 2/3 FPS, whose\nframe rate was naively reduced to two thirds. In addition,\nEVSO++, which aggressively reduces the frame rate, has an\naverage frame rate similar to 2/3 FPS, but the average quality\nscore is 16 points higher. This indicates that reducing the frame\nrate using EVSO leads to better quality than naively reducing\nthe frame rate.\nD. System Overhead\nWe measured the system overhead on a server equipped\nwith 2.20 GHz\u000240 processors and 135 GB of memory.\nExperiments were performed with the NBC video and the\naverage was measured after repeating the session ﬁve times\nfor accuracy.\nScheduling overhead: We measured how much scheduling overhead occurred when the Frame rate Scheduler\n(F-Scheduler) was built into the OpenH264 encoder. The\nOpenH264 encoder without and with F-Scheduler takes about21.85 seconds and 22.02 seconds on average, respectively.\nThe processing overhead incurred by F-Scheduler to schedule\nan adaptive frame rate for each video chunk is only 0.76%\non average, which clearly indicates that there is little or no\noverhead caused by the addition of F-Scheduler.\nVideo processing overhead: We measured how much processing overhead occurred when the Video Processor (VProcessor) processed a video based on the scheduling results from F-Scheduler. A video streaming server without VProcessor processes an uploaded video with various resolutions and bitrates, such as 720p (5 Mbps) and 480p (2.5 Mbps),\nto provide DASH functionality [13]. In addition to this task,\nV-Processor processes videos according to three battery levels.\nThe video streaming server without and with V-Processor\ntakes about 143 seconds and 289 seconds on average, respectively. This indicates that the processing overhead caused\nby V-Processor is approximately 100%. However, this video\nprocessing is internally handled by the streaming server and\nis a preliminary task performed prior to streaming the video\nto users. In addition, the time overhead can be signiﬁcantly\nreduced if V-Processor is performed based on a selective\nstrategy, such as processing only popular videos. Therefore,\nthe overhead caused by V-Processor can be tolerated by both\nthe user and streaming server.\nStorage overhead: Because the EVSO system generates additional videos based on the three battery levels, the amount\nof videos that need to be stored is nearly three times more\nthan a conventional streaming server. This may be a strain on\nthe storage requirement of the streaming server; however, this\nproblem can also be alleviated if V-Processor is selectively\nperformed only on popular videos, as described above.\nVI. R ELATED WORK\nA. Energy Saving when Streaming Videos\nLim et al. [4] extended the H.264/A VC encoder to provide a\nframe-skipping scheme during compression and transmission\nfor mobile screen sharing applications. This scheme can reduce\nthe energy consumption of mobile devices without signiﬁcantly affecting the user experience, as similar frames are\nskipped during compression and transmission. In addition, this\nscheme does not transmit unnecessary frames to the mobile\ndevice because it works on the server side, thus there is\na beneﬁt of increased available network bandwidth on the\nclient side. However, this scheme incurs high computational\noverhead because it calculates the similarity of all frames with\nthe SSIM method [5]. On the other hand, EVSO proposes\na novel M-Diff method specialized for a video encoder and\nprovides a ﬂexible way to adjust the frame rate according to\nthe current battery status of the mobile device.\nSince the wireless interface consumes a considerable\namount of energy on the mobile device, there have been\nseveral efforts to reduce the energy consumption by utilizing\na playback buffer when streaming videos [23], [24]. These\napproaches download a large amount of data in advance and\nstore it in the player’s playback buffer to increase the idle time\nof the wireless interface. These approaches are interoperable\nwith EVSO. However, if users frequently skip or quit while\nwatching the video, network bandwidth can be wasted because\nthe previously downloaded data is no longer used.\nKim et al. [7] adjusted a refresh rate of the screen by\ndeﬁning a content rate, which is the number of meaningful\nframes per second. If the content rate is low, this scheme\nreduces the refresh rate, which reduces the energy requirement\nwithout signiﬁcantly affecting the user experience. However,\nthe energy usage of the wireless interface, which is the main\nenergy-consuming factor in a video streaming, cannot be\nreduced at all because only the refresh rate on the user side\nis adjusted.\nB. Energy Saving for Mobile Games\nHwang et al. [5] introduced a rate-scaling technique called\nRA VEN that skips similar frames in the rendering loop while\nplaying games. This system uses Y-Diff method because the\nSSIM method has high computational overhead. The authors\nshowed that Y-Diff has accuracy comparable to SSIM in\nhuman visual perception. On the other hand, EVSO proposes a\nnovel M-Diff method specialized for a video streaming service.\nMoreover, RA VEN cannot be applied to a video streaming\nservice because it performs rate-scaling in the rendering loop\nfor mobile games.\nChen et al. [25] proposed a method called FingerShadow\nthat reduces the power consumption of the mobile device\nby applying a local dimming technique to the screen areas\ncovered by user’s ﬁnger while playing a game. However,\nthis approach requires external interaction with user behavior.\nIn contrast, EVSO is independent of external factors and\nperforms power savings using the motion intensity information\nof the video.\nVII. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we propose EVSO, which is a system that opportunistically applies adaptive frame rates for videos without\nrequiring any user effort. We introduce a similarity calculation\nmethod specialized for a video encoder and present a novel\nscheduling technique that assigns an appropriate frame rate to\neach video chunk. Our various experiments show that EVSO\nreduces the power requirement by as much as 27% on mobile\ndevices, with a little degradation of the user experience.\nAs future work, we plan to optimize various factors used in\nEVSO. A potential direction would be to use reinforcement\nlearning to optimize decisions and continue learning through\nthe policy training. The other direction would be to include\nmore videos with various frame rates in experiments.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers as well as our colleague\nJaehyun Park for their valuable comments and suggestions.\nThis research was a part of the project titled “SMARTNavigation project,” funded by the Ministry of Oceans and\nFisheries, Korea.

This may limit the e xtent to which natural selection can act on\necosystem structure.\n1 Introduction\nIn abstract terms, ecosystem ecology is about determining when t wo ecosystems, superﬁcially diﬀerent, are\nalike in some deeper way. Previous authors have chosen properties such as abundances (Ginzburg, 1983, p. 7),\nrelative abundances (Legendre and Legendre, 2012, p. 328), div ersity(Jost, 2006) and complexity of energyﬂow\npathways (Ulanowicz, 1986) as the relevant ways in which ecosyste ms may be alike. Since there are many such\nproperties, it is worth thinking about which ones to choose. In orde r to make this choice in a principled way,\nit is necessary to distinguish between an external observer of the ecosystem, who can decide which properties\nmatter to them, and an organism in the ecosystem, for whom the ch oice of properties is ﬁxed.\nThe properties that matter to an organism are closely related to its Hutchinson niche. Hutchinson (1957)\ndeﬁnedthenicheofanorganismasthesetofstatesoftheenviron mentpermittingaspeciestopersistindeﬁnitely.\nLater work makes it clear that by “persist indeﬁnitely”, it was meant that the proportional population growth\nrate for the species was non-negative (Hutchinson, 1978, p. 194 ), where proportional population growth rate is\nthe per-capita population growth rate when abundance is measure d in individuals, the mass-speciﬁc population\ngrowth rate when measured as biomass, and so on. This initial view of niche space was essentially static.\nMaguire (1973) introduced both structure and dynamics into niche space. Structure was provided by level sets\n(contours, if niche space is two-dimensional) of equal proportiona l population growth rate, and dynamics by\nmovement through niche space, driven either by external change s, or as a consequence of population growth.\nMaguire explicitly stated that this view of niche space allows us to exam ine “the total environment of a species,\na population, or an individual ...through its ‘biological eyes’”, in oth er words as an organism within the\necosystem would see it, rather than as an external observer. Of course, organisms do not “see” population\ngrowth rate, so that the “biological eyes” of a species must be inte rpreted as the outcome of the process relating\npopulation growth rate to environment.\nExponential growth of a population occurs when “nothing happens in the environment” (Ginzburg, 1986).\nHowever, it is worth thinking about what “nothing” means. Maguire ( 1973), and later Tilman (1980), concentratedonmovementthroughnichespace,fromonelevelsettoan other(Figure1, solidarrow). Sinceproportional\npopulation growth rate is changing, population growth is not expone ntial, and something is happening to the\nenvironment. A situation not considered in detail by Maguire (1973) and Tilman (1980) is shown by the dashed\narrow in Figure 1. Here, the environment is changing, but in such a wa y that we remain in the same level set in\nniche space. Although this is unlikely to occur in nature, it is important conceptually. In such cases, “nothing\nhappens” from the point of view of the species, even though to an e xternal observer, something is happening.\nIn general, two ecosystems which are superﬁcially diﬀerent can be e quivalent from the point of view of a species\nif they are in the same level set in niche space and therefore lead to t he same proportional population growth\nrate. In other words, proportional population growth rates are the natural units in which to measure ecosystem\nstate from the point of view of an organism, and there is no necessa ry connection between these natural units\nand the properties of the system that seem most natural to an ex ternal observer (Rosen, 1978, p. xii).\nThis natural deﬁnition of ecosystem state suggests some immediat e questions. First, applying this deﬁnition\nacross all species in an ecosystem leads to a high-dimensional state . Ecosystem properties visible to an external\nobserver, such as diversity, are often summarized in a low-dimensio nal way, for example using diversity indices\n(Jost, 2006). Can the same be done for the natural measure of e cosystem state? Second, the relationship\nbetween the dynamics of an ecosystem (including all properties tha t an external observer could measure) and\nthe dynamics of ecosystem states (as experienced by organisms) may have important consequences for attempts\nto explain patterns in ecosystem structure (Borrelli et al., 2015). Natural selection cannot distinguish between\ngroups of organisms with the same proportional population growth rates. As a result, there will be variation\namong ecosystems (visible to an external observer) on which natu ral selection cannot act. To what extent does\nthis limit the role of natural selection as an explanation for ecosyste m structure?\nHere, I deﬁne equivalence of ecosystems from the point of view of t he organisms involved, in terms of\nproportional population growth rates. I outline the relationship be tween dynamics on equivalence classes of\necosystems(from the point ofview oforganisms)anddynamics ass een byan externalobserver. I identify classes\nof ecosystems diﬀering in the relationship between these two kinds o f dynamics. I discuss the consequences of\nthese ideas for comparative studies of ecosystems, summaries of ecosystem state, and the mechanisms that may\ngenerate regularities at the ecosystem level.\n2 Equivalence from the point of view of organisms\nDeﬁnition 1. Let Ω be a volume in twoor three-dimensional physical space. Let x= (x1,x2,...,x n) be the\nabundances (e.g. numbers of individuals, if individuals are well-deﬁned , or cover or biomass otherwise) of all the\nnspecies present in Ω ( xi∈R>0,i= 1,...,n). Lety=y1,y2,...,y mbe the values of all the physicochemical\nvariables aﬀecting any of these species ( yi∈R,i= 1,...,m). Thens={Ω,x,y}is anecosystem .\nDeﬁnition 1 is not greatly diﬀerent from standard usage, but it is nec essary to have a precise deﬁnition. Let\nSbe the set of ecosystems in which exactly the same set of nspecies are present. Let αbe an endomap of S\n(a function with domain and codomain S: Lawvere and Schanuel, 2009, p. 15), describing ecosystem dyn amics\nwithinS. In what follows, I assume for simplicity that dynamics operate in disc rete time. Essentially the same\narguments as those below can be made in continuous time, the only diﬀ erence being that there must then be\nan endomap αtfor each real number t, satisfying α0= 1S(the identity in S) andαt+u=αt◦αu, i.e. the\ncomposition αtfollowingαu(Lawvere and Schanuel, 2009, p. 169).\nLetri:S→Rbe a function such that ri(s) is the contribution of endogenous processes (e.g. births\nand deaths) to the proportional growth rate of the ith species. In a ﬁnite population, this is interpreted as\nthe expected value over demographic stochasticity. There is no ne ed to consider environmental stochasticity,\nbecause by deﬁnition, all the variables that aﬀect riare speciﬁed in s. I do not require that sis a closed\necosystem, but I do not include immigration and emigration in ri(s). This is consistent with the view that\nimmigration and emigration should not be considered when determining the suitability of an environment for\na species, which resolves some of the problems with connecting the d eﬁnition of a niche to the distribution of a\nspecies (Drake and Richards, 2017).\nTo theith species, two ecosystems s,s′∈Sare equivalent if and only if ri(s) =ri(s′). As argued above,\nwhen this condition is satisﬁed, the two ecosystems lie in the same leve l set in niche space for the ith species, so\nthat from the point of view of the species, “nothing happens” if we m ove from one to the other, even though the\necosystems may appear diﬀerent to an external observer. In ot her words, a unit of abundance of the ith species\nin ecosystem swould neither beneﬁt nor suﬀer in evolutionary terms if exchanged w ith a unit of abundance of\nifrom ecosystem s′. Let∼ibe the relation deﬁned on Sbys∼is′if and only if ri(s) =ri(s′). This is an\nequivalence relation because it is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive (Halmos, 1974, p. 28). The elements of\nthe quotient set S/∼i(the equivalence classes of ∼iinS) are the level sets in niche space for species i, provided\nthat the abundance of any species having a direct eﬀect on riis included as a niche axis (Maguire, 1973).\nDeﬁnition 2. Letrbe the function\nr:S→Rn\ns/mapsto→(r1(s),...,r n(s)),\nwhich maps ecosystems to n-tuples of real numbers representing proportional population gr owth rates of all\nspecies. Because the set of such n-tuples is important, it is worth giving it a symbol ( R) and a name: the\ngrowth space of the ecosystem (Spencer, 2015). Let ∼be the relation on Sdeﬁned byr(i.e.s∼s′means that\nr(s) =r(s′)). Again, this is reﬂexive, transitive and symmetric, so it is an equiva lence relation. Then I say\nthat ecosystems s,s′∈Sareequivalent (from the point of view of every species) if and only if s∼s′. In other\nwords, two ecosystems are equivalent if and only if for each species , the proportional population growth rate\ndoes not diﬀer between the ecosystems.\nThe elements of the quotient set S/∼are the intersections of the quotient sets S/∼1,...,S/∼n, i.e.S/∼=\nS/(∩n\ni=1∼i). In biological terms, these are the intersections of a given set of level sets for each species in niche\nspace. Note that some of these intersections may be empty. Stud ying intersections of sets in niche space has\nbeen productive in the past. For example, Hutchinson (1957) focu sed on intersections of the sets ri≥0, and\nTilman (1980) focused on intersections of the level sets ri= 0, in order to study the potential for coexistence.\nHowever, the intersections ofother level sets arealso biologicallyim portant, a point I return to in the discussion.\nI do not assume that either αorrhas any particular form. In general, the equations describing ecos ystem\ndynamics are unknown. For example, the Lotka-Volterra equation s can usefully be thought of as a second-order\nTaylor polynomial approximation to some more complicated system (H utchinson, 1978, p. 117), but there are\nfew situations in which one would believe that these are the true equa tions. It is possible to constrain the form\nof the functions ribased on a few axioms (Cropp and Norbury, 2015). Although I do no t follow this up here,\nit may lead to a deeper understanding of the range of possible dynam ics on equivalence classes.\nIalsodonotassumethatspecifying rissuﬃcienttospecify α. Althoughendogenousdynamicsareimportant,\nimmigration and emigration of organisms, and external factors inﬂu encing environmental conditions, must also\nbe speciﬁed in order to know the future state of an ecosystem. Clo sed ecosystems have received more theoretical\nattention, but ecosystems with input and output of of nutrients a nd organisms can have qualitatively diﬀerent\ndynamics (Loreau and Holt, 2004).\nIt is worth emphasizing again that it is proportional growth rates an d nothing else that determine whether\ntwo ecosystems are equivalent from the point of view of the organis ms involved. For example, two ecosystems\nwhich happen to have the same abundance of every species (and ma y therefore be viewed as equivalent by an\nexternal observer) may or may not be equivalent to the organisms involved. On the other hand, each internal\nequilibrium of a deterministic system is a member of S, and all these equilibria are equivalent, since ri(s) = 0 for\ni= 1,...,n, by deﬁnition. Thus what are usually called alternative stable states are invisible (in evolutionary\nterms) to the organisms involved, if every species is present in each of these states.\n3 The category of sets with endomaps\nA category can be thought of as a set of objects A,B,C,... and a set of arrows f,g,h,... , such that:\n1. Each arrow fhas some object Aas its domain (source) and some object Bas its codomain (target);\n2. There is an identity, consisting of an arrow 1 Afor each object Awith domain and codomain A;\n3. Any pair of arrows f,gsuch that the codomain of fis the domain of gcan be composed to form a\ncomposite arrow g◦ffrom the domain of fto the codomain of g;\n4. Composition is associative, i.e. h◦(g◦f) = (h◦g)◦f;\n5. Composition satisﬁes the unit laws, that for arrows fwith codomain B, andgwith domain B, 1B◦f=f\nandg◦1B=g;\n(Lawvere and Schanuel, 2009, p. 21).\nFor example, a set of ecosystems Swith an endomap αis an object in the category of sets with endomaps\n(Lawvere and Schanuel, 2009, p. 136). An arrow fin this category from a set Xwith endomap γto a setY\nwith endomap δmust preserve the structure of the endomap, in the sense that it must satisfy\nf◦γ=δ◦f. (1)\nIntuitively, this means that we can either follow dynamics on Xand then map the result to Y, or map to\nYand then follow the corresponding dynamics of the result on Y. Thus the dynamical structure on Xdeﬁned\nby the endomap γis preserved in the structure on Ydeﬁned by the endomap δ.\n4 Can dynamics on Rhave the same structure as dynamics on S?\nDynamics on S(visible to an external observer) induce dynamics on R(as experienced by organisms in the\necosystem). We want to know whether these dynamics have the sa me structure, in the sense of Equation 1. To\nanswer this question, we must ﬁrst attempt to specify an endomap βonRthat describes these dynamics.\nA natural choice for βis a map taking r(s) to (r◦α)(s) (the outcome of dynamics on ecosystems, mapped to\nR), if such a map exists. Thus, suppose that z∈r(S). To get from z=r(s) toβ(z) = (r◦α)(s), we have to ﬁrst\ngo back toS, then apply αand ﬁnally go from the result of this to R. The function ris not in general one-one,\nso it will not in general have a retraction ˜ rthat undoes it in the sense that ˜ r◦r= 1S(Lawvere and Schanuel,\n2009, p. 53). However, we can construct the function\nr′:r(S)→S\nz/mapsto→s∗,\nwheres∗is an arbitrary representative of the set {s∈S:r(s) =z}. Then if the function r◦α◦r′exists, it is\nthe natural choice for βonr(S). For elements of Routside the image set of Sunderr, we can deﬁne βin an\narbitrary way, say β= 1R.\nIt is clear that we will not always be able to construct βin this way. In fact, if we cannot, then there is no\nendomap on Rsuch thatris a structure-preserving map from StoR.\nTheorem 1. The mapr:S→Rcan be a structure-preserving map if and only if the endomap αonSsatisﬁes\ns∼s′=⇒α(s)∼α(s′)∀s,s′∈S. (2)\nProof.First, I show that if Condition 2 holds, then the endomap βonRis structure-preserving. If the condition\nholds, then by the deﬁnition of ∼,s∼s′=⇒(r◦α)(s) = (r◦α)(s′). Then\nβ:R→R\nz/mapsto→\n\n(r◦α)(s) ifz∈r(S),\nz otherwise(3)\nis avalid endomapon R(because it has domain and codomain R, and associatesa single element of its codomain\nwith each element of its domain). It also satisﬁes r◦α=β◦r, and is therefore structure-preserving.\nNow, I show that if Condition 2 does not hold, then there cannot be a ny endomap on Rsuch thatris\nstructure-preserving. Suppose that there exist s,s′∈Ssuch thats∼s′, butα(s)/ne}ationslash∼α(s′). Then by the\ndeﬁnition of ∼,r(s) =r(s′), but (r◦α)(s)/ne}ationslash= (r◦α)(s′). There cannot be any function γthat mapsr(s) =r(s′)\nto both (r◦α)(s) and (r◦α)(s′)/ne}ationslash= (r◦α)(s) when these elements are distinct, and hence it is not possible to\nsatisfyr◦α=γ◦r.\nI have shown that if Condition 2 holds, then there is a natural choice of endomap βsuch thatris a\nstructure-preserving map from StoR, and that if it does not hold, then there can be no such map.\nTheorem 1 makes intuitive sense. Condition 2 says that for dynamics on the set of equivalence classes to\npreserve the structure in ecosystem dynamics, the ecosystem d ynamics must not separate equivalence classes.\nFor example, in Figure 2a, the structure of αcan be preserved by r, becauseαkeeps members of equivalence\nclasses together, while in Figure 2b, the structure of αcannot be preserved by rbecausesands′are in the\nsame equivalence class but are mapped by αto diﬀerent equivalence classes. Condition 2 is somewhat analogous\nto the condition under which a function of a Markov chain will be Marko vian (Burke and Rosenblatt, 1958).\nTo ﬁnd examples of endomaps αsatisfying Condition 2, I ﬁrst construct a function φ:S→Ssuch that\ns∼s′⇐⇒φ(s) =φ(s′).\nLemma 1. Letφbe the function\nφ:S→S\ns/mapsto→s∗such thats∼s∗,\ni.e.s∗is any ﬁxed representative of the equivalence class of sonS. Thens∼s′⇐⇒φ(s) =φ(s′).\nProof.Ifs∼s′, thenφ(s) =φ(s′) =s∗. Conversely, if s/ne}ationslash∼s′, thenφ(s) =s∗, butφ(s′)/ne}ationslash=s∗, since an\nequivalence relation on SpartitionsS(Halmos, 1974, p. 28), so that s∗cannot be equivalent to both sand\ns′.\nWe can now rewrite Condition 2 as\nφ(s) =φ(s′) =⇒(φ◦α)(s) = (φ◦α)(s′)∀s,s′∈S. (4)\n5 Classes of ecosystem dynamics\nIt is useful to distinguishthree classesofecosystemdynamics, ba sedonwhether andhowCondition 4is satisﬁed:\n(a) Condition 4 holds because φ◦α=φ, soris a map in the category of sets with endomaps. Some of the\npossible ways this could occur are:\n(i) Ifα= 1S, thenφ◦α=φ, and Condition 4 holds. This is the trivial case in which ecosystems nev er\nchange.\n(ii) Note that φis idempotent (i.e. φ◦φ=φ), since (φ◦φ)(s) =φ(s∗) =s∗=φ(s), for anys∈S. Hence\nα=φalso satisﬁes Condition 4, and is not equal to 1 S, provided that at least one equivalence class\nhas more than one member. There is no obvious biological example of t his case.\n(iii) If resource levels change over time, but in such a way that rremains constant (as in Figure 1, dashed\narrow), then α/ne}ationslash= 1S, butφ◦α=φ. This could in principle be achieved in a controlled laboratory\nsystem, but does not appear likely in nature.\n(iv) Finally and most importantly, consider an inﬁnite well-mixed space Ω , and a set of species interacting\nonly through resource depletion and production of waste product s. The proportional growth rate of\neach species depends on physicochemical variables yand will not in general be zero. Thus in a closed\nsystem, we expect abundances xto change over time, so α/ne}ationslash= 1S. Furthermore, because Ω is inﬁnite\nand well-mixed, ydoes not change over time, so proportional growth rates do not c hange over time\nand the abundance of each species grows or declines exponentially. Thus in this case, ecosystems\nchange, while remaining in the same equivalence class, and Condition 4 is satisﬁed. This Malthusian\nsituation is an important starting point for theory, analogous to th e role of a body with no forces\nacting on it in physics (Ginzburg, 1986). In the real world, a similar sit uation can be realized in a\nchemostat in which the ecosystem is open and proportional populat ion growth rates are constant but\nnot necessarily zero, while abundances in the system do not change .\n(b) Condition 4 holds even though φ◦α/ne}ationslash=φ. In other words, ecosystems change equivalence class over time,\nbut these dynamics keep members of the same equivalence class tog ether, so that ris a map in the category\nof sets with endomaps. There are several possible examples.\n(i) Suppose that rdepends on sonly as a one-one function of a single physicochemical variable y, and\nthat changes in abundances xdo not aﬀect y. Then each equivalence class of Scontains ecosystems\nwith a single value of y, but potentially diﬀering in x. Changes in ywill lead to dynamics among\nequivalence classes, but the members of an equivalence class will sta y together. In idealized stream\nor soil ecosystems, ycould represent detritus, and xdetritivores with pure donor-controlled dynamics\n(Pimm, 1982, p. 136), with change over time caused by variation in inp ut and output of the resource.\nAlternatively, ycould be an environmental variable whose eﬀects dominate all other variables, with\nchange over time caused by extrinsic environmental variability.\n(ii) Suppose that proportional population growth rates in a closed s ystem depend only on xthrough the\nrelative abundances ρ= (/summationtextn\ni=1xi)−1x. Letψbe a function from Sn−1×R≥0(where the simplex\nSn−1contains the relative abundances, and R≥0contains a time diﬀerence) to Rn. Then for some\ntime interval ∆ t, ecosystem dynamics αare given by\nα:S→S,\n(Ω,x,y)/mapsto→(Ω,x⊙ψ(ρ,∆t),y),\nwhere⊙denotes the elementwise (Hadamard) product. Hence for any give n set of relative abundances\nρ, all ecosystems with abundances of the form cρfor some positive number cmap to ecosystems with\nabundances of the form cx⊙ψ(ρ,∆t). Also, for each species i,\nri(s) = lim\n∆t→0ψi(ρ,∆t)−1\n∆t,\nwhich depends on xonly through ρ. Thus all ecosystems with abundances of the form cρ, for ﬁxedρ,\nwill be in an equivalenceclass, and will be mapped tothe samenew equiva lence classby α. Ecosystems\nof this kind have purely frequency-dependent dynamics, implicitly as sumed in models based only on\nrelative abundances. Arditi and Ginzburg (2012, section 6.1) argu e that this kind of scaling invariance\nmay be a desirable property. Frequency dependence is certainly po ssible (e.g. Hutchinson, 1978, pp.\n134-135), and is sometimes likely to be important. For example, if spa ce is limiting, and all the\navailable space is always ﬁlled, frequency dependence may be the dom inant way in which abundances\naﬀect proportional population growth rates.\n(c) In most cases, Condition 4 will not be satisﬁed, and so rwill not be a map in the category of sets with\nendomaps. For example, consider a closed ecosystem containing a s ingle species of phytoplankton with\nabundance x, whose proportional population growth rate (1 /x)(dx/dt) depends on the concentrations of\nnitrogen (N) and phosphorus ( P), which are used during growth but not recycled. A simple model for such\nan ecosystem, from Maguire (1973), is\ndx\ndt=x/parenleftBig\nrmax−/radicalbig\na(N−N∗)2+b(P−P∗)2/parenrightBig\n,\ndN\ndt=−cdx\ndt,\ndP\ndt=−ddx\ndt,(5)\nwherermaxis the maximum possible proportional population growth rate, attain ed at optimum concentrationsN∗,P∗of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively, parameters aandbdetermine how quickly proportional population growth rate declines as nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, respectively, are moved\naway from the optimum, and c,dare quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus needed to produce a un it of\nbiomass, respectively. The space Ω is not explicitly deﬁned, but s={Ω,x,N,P}is an ecosystem. Consider\nthe mapαdeﬁned by\nα:S→S,\n{Ω,x0,N0,P0} /mapsto→ {Ω,x(1),N(1),P(1)},\nwherex0,N0,P0are initial values, and x(1),N(1),P(1) are solutions of Equation 5 after one unit of time.\nApplying this map to some of the ecosystems in the equivalence class {s∈S:r(s) = 1}(Figure 3, bold\nblack line) gives sets of ecosystems (Figure 3, black lines: each line co rresponds to a diﬀerent value of\nx0) which cut contours of proportional population growth rate (Figu re 3, grey lines) and thus separate\nequivalence classes.\n6 Discussion\nI argued above that two ecosystems are equivalent if and only if for each species, the proportional population\ngrowth rate does not diﬀer between the ecosystems. Much of com munity ecology is devoted to searching for\npatterns in variables such as species abundances or relative abund ances, measures of diversity and measures of\ncomplexity. A consequence of my argument is that such activities will not lead to a deeper understanding of\nhow organismsexperience ecosystems. Instead, it may be more pr oductive to searchfor patterns in proportional\npopulation growth rates.\nAlternative stable states provide a good example of the consequen ces of this change of viewpoint. Determining whether a set of ecosystems has alternative stable states is a c hallenging problem (Petraitis, 2013). However,\nif these states contain the same set of species, they are all equiva lent to the organisms involved. The distinctive\nfeature of alternative stable states is that the equivalence class in which all species have zero proportional population growth rate consists of more than one disjoint subset. Gen eralizing, it appears likely that when some\nspecies have nonzero proportional population growth rates, the re will also exist equivalence classes consisting\nof more than one disjoint subset. For example, if the level sets of p roportional population growth rates for two\nspecies are ellipsoids in niche space, then their intersection may cons ist of a pair of disjoint lower-dimensional\nellipsoids. Roughly ellipsoidal level sets are expected if the axes of nic he space include interactive resources\n(Tilman, 1980), for which each species has a ﬁnite optimum value. This is not an outlandish biologicalsituation.\nThus, equivalence classesconsisting of disjoint sets ofecosystem s with quite diﬀerent physicochemicalproperties\nare plausible. This has been recognized, at least implicitly, in discussion s of the “double zero problem”. It has\nbeen claimed that shared absence of a species arising from an unsuit able environment does not provide useful\ninformation about ecosystem similarity because the environment ma y be unsuitable in diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent\necosystems (e.g. Legendre and Legendre, 2012, pp. 271-272). This is taking the view of an external observer\nwho measures physicochemical conditions, rather than an organis m in the ecosystem.\nIt is unlikely that two real ecosystems will ever be exactly equivalent . In empirical work, it may therefore\nbe useful to measure how far two ecosystems are from being equiv alent. This is analogous to the common\napproach of measuring dissimilarity between ecosystems (Legendr e and Legendre, 2012, chapter 7), but from\nthe point of view of the organisms involved. What properties should b e possessed by a measure of how far from\nequivalence two ecosystems s1,s2are? Letd(s1,s2) be such a measure. Convention suggests that we should\nhaved(s1,s2)≥0 for alls1,s2∈S. It will usually be sensible to require that d(s1,s2) = 0 if and only if\nr(s1) =r(s2) (i.e. the two ecosystems are equivalent). There is in general no re ason to privilege one ecosystem\nover another, so it is natural to require that d(s1,s2) =d(s2,s1). A measure with all these properties is a\nsemimetric (Legendre and Legendre, 2012, p. 295). There are ma ny measures with these properties, of which\nthe most obvious is Euclidean distance, which also satisﬁes the triang le inequality, and is therefore a metric\n(Sutherland, 2009, p. 39): this last property may not be necessa ry, but is at worst harmless, and is often useful.\nOnce a suitable measure has been chosen, popular activities such as ordination (Legendre and Legendre, 2012,\nchapter 9) can be done from the point of view of organisms, rather than that of an external observer. It may\nbe useful to think of this measure as describing dissimilarity in niche sp ace, as well as in growth space.\nGiven that the state r(s) of an ecosystem (the n-tuple of proportional population growth rates for all the\nspecies it contains) is typically high-dimensional, it is natural to ask wh ether it can be summarized. Any\nfunction of r(s) is invariant under dynamics within an equivalence class, and might the refore be considered as a\nsummary of ecosystem state. In contrast, anything which is not a function of r(s) will separate measures of the\nsame equivalence class, and is therefore not a summary of ecosyst em state. Many commonly-used measures of\n“rate of succession” such as Euclidean distances, Bray-Curtis dis tances and chi-square distances among relative\nabundances, reviewed in Spencer (2015, Appendix B), are not mea sures of ecosystem state, because they can\ntake more than one value for the same value of r(s), and therefore split up equivalence classes. As a ﬁrst\nexample of something that is a valid summary of ecosystem state, pr oportional population growth rates are\nlikely to be unknown for most species in an ecosystem. In practice, it will be necessary to work with the m-tuple\nof proportional population growth rates that are known, where m <n. Since this is a function of r(s), it is a\nsummary of ecosystem state. As a second example, the Living Plane t Index (Loh et al., 2005), which is closely\nrelated to the mean of the elements of r(s), and the shape change measure proposed by Spencer (2015), w hich is\nthe sample standard deviation of the elements of r(s), are both scalar summaries of ecosystem state (although\nthey were both originally presented as measures of change in ecosy stem state). However, two ecosystems with\nthe same value of one of these functions may not be equivalent from the point of view of any species. For\nexample, two ecosystems may have the same mean of r(s), even though the proportional population growth\nrates maydiﬀer between the ecosystemsfor everyspecies. Thus , one could only claim equivalence from the point\nofview ofatypicalspecies, ora specieschosenat random. This cha ngein viewpointfrom particularto aggregate\nproperties demands a justiﬁcation which is currently lacking, in the s ame way that studying biodiversity per se\n(an aggregate property) rather than the particular species in an ecosystem (each contributing to the aggregate\nproperty) demands a justiﬁcation (Maier, 2012, pp. 75-76). The re might be situations in conservation biology\nwhere the justiﬁcation could be a “veil of ignorance” argument, sim ilar to that used to agree principles of justice\nvia the hypothetical situation in which individuals do not know their plac e in society (Rawls, 1999, p. 118). For\nexample, an external observermight believe that species diﬀer in th eir importance, even though the importances\nwere unknown. In such a case, studying a typical species might be s ensible. As far as I know, such arguments\nhave not been developed in detail.\nThe structural diﬀerence between dynamics on equivalence classe s of ecosystems and the dynamics of ecosystems has important consequences for the processes that gener ate repeatable patterns at the ecosystem level. An\ninﬂuential, if controversial, idea in ecosystem ecology is that ecosys tems are shaped by natural selection on the\nabilitytocaptureenergy(Lotka,1922). Lotka’sargumentrelieso nthe assumptionthat increasedenergycapture\nincreases proportional population growth rate, and can therefo re be subject to natural selection. Lotka proposed that such selection on energy capture leads to maximization o f biomass and energy ﬂow at the ecosystem\nlevel. However, variation within equivalence classes is invisible to natur al selection, but visible to an external\nobserver. Thus, natural selection cannot act on variation in ecos ystem properties within equivalence classes.\nIn the abstract language of Rosen (1978, p. 66), ecosystem dyn amics are in general incompatible with the\nequivalence classes of ecosystems, and will thus appear acausal t o an organism in the ecosystem. I argued above\nthat equivalence classes may be disjoint, containing ecosystems wit h quite diﬀerent physicochemical properties.\nIf there are regularities at the ecosystem level, either they must b e at the level of equivalence classes, or they\nmust be generated by some mechanism other than natural selectio n. Stability selection is one such mechanism\n(Borrelli et al., 2015). Stability selection acts “without ‘seeing’ the local environment” (Damuth and Ginzburg,\n2018), or in other words, it does not act via proportional populatio n growth rates. It is therefore unlinked\nfrom the equivalence classes of an ecosystem, and may have the po tential to generate regularities even within\nequivalence classes.\nIn conclusion, I distinguish between the view of ecosystems taken b y an external observer, with the ability\nto study whatever they like, and an organism in an ecosystem, for w hom only proportional population growth\nrates are visible. This distinction leads to major diﬀerences in the app roachthat should be taken to comparative\nstudies of ecosystems, suggests open questions about how to su mmarize the state of an ecosystem, and clariﬁes\nthe limits on the ability of natural selection to act on ecosystem stru cture.\nThis work was funded by NERC grant NE/K00297X/1.

Dept. of Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Abstract. Mathematical models have come to play a key role in global pandemic preparedness and outbreak response: helping to plan for disease burden, hospital capacity, and inform non-pharmaceutical interventions. Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models - and, by consequence, modelers - guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have systematically failed to account for the social and structural factors which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of this limited framework? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this Perspective, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as “equal opportunity infectors” despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) as a potential blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms. Author Contributions: JZ, NM, RM and RN wrote the manuscript. SM and MC provided detailed feedback and edits over multiple drafts.\n2 Introduction In March 2020, a prescient news item in Science proclaimed that infectious disease transmission models had taken on \"life or death importance\"1 as tools in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Despite the pivotal role transmission models and modelers have played, most models used to guide the global response to SARS-CoV-2 paid virtually no attention to the causes of the massive socioeconomic and racial inequities that have characterized the pandemic2-4. As ongoing domestic and global vaccination campaigns and the emergence of novel and more infectious variants continue to highlight new facets of inequity in the COVID-19 crisis, recent comprehensive reviews of the transmission modeling literature have begun to grapple with how transmission models can and should account for ‘social factors’ going forward5,6. These reviews highlight the increased use of detailed information on mobility and individual behavior to make better predictions of epidemic trajectories and estimates of model parameters. In broad strokes, they argue for more detailed data collection and closer partnership with communities to ensure that models incorporate local data and address real-world needs. These are critically important points. However, more and better data - even when collected and used in partnership with affected communities - does not guarantee models that address the roots of infection inequity. In this piece, we advocate for an approach to infectious disease modeling that explicitly includes overarching social factors, like socioeconomic status (SES), racism, and segregation that put individuals and populations “at risk of risk”7. We do not in any way eschew the use of detailed, high-resolution social data as a tool for combating infectious disease. Instead, we worry that the power of these tools to prevent and ameliorate inequity may be squandered if their use is not informed by key concepts from the vast literature on health disparities in both infectious and non-communicable disease: When structural causes are excluded from transmission models, they cannot be used to examine how structural remedies, like wealth transfers, universal healthcare, and guaranteed housing might impact incidence and mortality rates. These omissions are not the fault of individual authors, and no model can be expected to capture the full gamut of social and biological causes of infection. Instead, the absence of models that account for these higher-order factors reflects a lack of a digestible framework for including social inequality as a first-class feature in transmission models. The current moment provides an opportunity to rectify this gap. COVID-19 has increased awareness of the fact that flesh-and-blood social inequities underlie the values of abstract model parameters. For example, Richardson et al. have argued that, in the United States, the basic reproduction number, 𝑅!, must be understood not only in terms of pathogen biology and individual behavior, but also of structural violence. Various axes of difference - race and class among them -- compel some to be routinely and non-randomly exposed and allows others to remain relatively safe.8 Similarly, the social epidemiologist David Williams has argued that herd immunity should be reconceptualized in explicitly social terms which recognize that the level of immunity from natural infection and vaccination is a function not only of pathogen biology, but the social and economic systems that propel transmission and health behavior.9 While structural inequalities have been largely absent from models of ARIs such as SARS-CoV-2 and pandemic influenza, they have long been at the heart of modeling work on HIV as well as a range of viral and bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Because transmission of STIs typically requires direct contact, interpersonal relationships and the social factors that structure them cannot be ignored, and there is a vast literature examining inequities in HIV and STI infection using populationand network-based transmission models10-12. By contrast, transmission of ARIs through the air via respiratory droplets and aerosols makes mapping of social relationships onto transmission less straightforward, although smaller-scale studies have demonstrated the role of individual-level patterns of contact in influenza transmission13. This disconnect has contributed to the erroneous, but pervasive, idea that ARIs are \"equal opportunity infectors\"14 for which the structure of social networks and systems of both global and domestic\n3 inequality and oppression are less important than for quintessentially social pathogens like HIV, STIs, and TB. COVID-19 has dealt a significant blow to this idea, but it remains to be seen how we can capitalize on that momentum to make the necessary changes to the modeling toolkit. The way we represent cause and effect in transmission models has enormous implications for policy and practice. Transmission models let practitioners, policymakers, and researchers envision alternative futures that might be realized through intervention, policy, and social action. When these models exclude social-structural factors that drive inequity - income, education, racial residential segregation, and occupational hazards - they preclude the ability to explore the possibility of structural change as an epidemiological tool on par with NPIs, vaccination, and testing. In the following sections, we outline an “equity-forward” approach to transmission modeling that places the fundamental structural causes of infection inequality on an equal level with the biological and behavioral features of transmission. Our goal is to articulate a vision of socially informed modeling that is squarely focused on understanding how imbalances in social power drive infection inequalities and suggesting social and political remedies to these disparities. What are the goals of equity-forward transmission modeling? Transmission models are often used to answer ‘what-if’ questions from a perspective of power or authority: What will happen if governments impose quarantines or mask-wearing orders? How should national, state and local public health authorities allocate scarce vaccines? These questions lend themselves to a focus on predicting the timing and spatial distribution of infection over short and long time horizons5. This focus on predicting the future is most relevant for a decision-maker who is anticipating, planning, and responding to events in the near future.15 This may explain the sustained focus on developing epidemic forecasting models despite their spotty track record at predicting the future16. Recent reviews have argued that the failures of the predictive/forecasting approach may be traceable to missing social data or the omission of behavioral feedbacks, e.g. individuals restricting their contacts in response to rising caseloads, and that this gap can be closed with more data and more-detailed models. But what if this failure instead reflects the unpredictability of the social, political, and economic human substrate of transmission? The COVID-19 crisis has illustrated how the trajectory of world-historic events like pandemics are shaped by a combination of pathogen biology, human social structures, and contingent historical events that confound efforts to anticipate the future with any degree of certainty. While forecasting may have a role to play in managing an ongoing crisis, we argue that the focus on optimizing models for short-term prediction is at best ancillary to and at worst an active impediment towards pursuing the goal of equity. For infectious disease models to be more useful as tools for addressing inequity, they need to be primarily diagnostic and forensic in the sense of being tools we use to identify and measure the causes of disparity. Because the remedies to structural inequities are not discrete, one-off interventions, but instead messy and protracted contests over power, equity-forward models must provide evidence and ideas that can propel and support efforts at social and political change. They should draw on historical and contemporary data to provide a map of a potential path from the unjust here to a more-just there. This requires evaluating the impact of social policies and movements on infection outcomes over longer periods of time, and focusing on ‘what-if’ questions that center on the conditions prior to a crisis: What if the burden of racial residential and occupational segregation was eased or eliminated before the next pandemic? What if healthcare was freely available to all during the first days and weeks transmission of a novel respiratory pathogen? How would this change the constellation of downstream factors we typically address one at a time? How would outcomes improve based on this comprehensive, structural change as compared to the more reactive approach that the prospective, forecasting paradigm facilitates?\n4 Rather than a primary focus on predicting the future (i.e. the pace and timing of infection) at a population level, an equity-forward modeling approach should be concerned with characterizing who is likely to be infected and how the distribution of infection reflects allocations of economic and social power at the population level. Accomplishing this requires transmission models that simultaneously accommodate social and biological mechanisms of interpersonal dependence at levels that are higher than individual-to-individual interactions. For example, aggressive COVID-19 lockdowns were enabled by the labor of healthcare, retail, delivery, and warehouse workers who continued to provide goods and services to people stuck at home. As a result, these workers bore much of the brunt of early exposure, infection, and death. This means that lower rates of exposure experienced by wealthier individuals and Whites17 are a direct result of economic and racial power imbalances. For epidemiological models to be faithful representations of the way infection risk occurs, this type of social dependence needs to be understood to be of equal importance to faithfully representing disease system as the specification of the biological states an individual progresses through following infection. Defining the key mechanisms and outcomes in an equity-forward transmission model. We advocate for an adaptation of the fundamental-cause (FC) perspective on health inequity to the problem of transmission. Link & Phelan define a fundamental social cause of health inequity as a factor, like socioeconomic status (SES) or racism, that puts individuals and populations “at risk of risks”7. The FC approach focuses on how differentials in social power impact access to the material and social resources - money, occupation, housing, medical care, education, prestige - that structure risks of infection and death. There is nothing new in the idea that social factors are causes of infection on par with biological ones. In the early 19th-century, the French social hygienist Rene Villerme documented strong associations among income, working conditions, and health.18 In the 1950s, the social medicine pioneers René and Jean-Baptiste Dubos referred to the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis as a necessary, but insufficient precondition for TB infection, with social and occupational factors ultimately shaping exposure and susceptibility19,20. Similarly, public health historian Samuel Kelton Roberts detailed how racial residential segregation drove TB infection and mortality among African-Americans in 20th century Baltimore via impacts on housing, workplace conditions, medical treatment, and public health policies21. These mechanisms have been repeatedly articulated in narrative histories, risk-factor analyses, and mixed-methods studies of many infections including Cholera22 HIV23,24, and malaria25,26. Clouston et al. found that while high-income U.S. counties were the first to see an introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pace of infection and mortality in these counties quickly slowed through non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (e.g. work from home, school closures). Meanwhile, rates of infection and death exploded in counties with lower-income and higher proportions of non-White residents where NPIs were less feasible.1 Given the ubiquity of the FC perspective in explicit and implicit understandings of infectious disease risk, its absence from transmission modeling is surprising. We argue that the FC approach provides a useful set of principles which can guide equity-forward modeling. To conclude this essay, we outline three core tenets of FC theory and highlight how they relate to the mechanisms of infectious disease transmission (see Figure 1), with an eye towards how they could be integrated into transmission models: 1. Social factors such as SES and racism are fundamental causes of infection because they operate on multiple intervening mechanisms that drive transmission, including housing, occupation, healthcare, and others. The proximal factors that drive exposure and mortality risk are socially correlated: Individuals in high-risk occupations are more likely to live in crowded conditions and have poor access to care and prevention. Due to such residential segregation and occupational clustering in certain higher-risk sectors (e.g. low-wage service work), individuals sharing these risks are also more likely to have high rates of contact with each other, concentrating the impact of these differential risks within marginalized groups27. Transmission models must not ignore the fact that these proximal drivers\n5 flow from upstream causes, lest they may make overly optimistic projections of the impact of tweaks to individual proximal risk factors and under-estimate the impact of higher-level social interventions that would improve multiple downstream factors simultaneously. 2. Protective non-pharmaceutical interventions, policies, and medical innovations reach more-advantaged individuals first, and this access is the cause of deprivation among lower-SES individuals and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing are structured by economic and racial privilege. In the context of an emerging infection, these effects may be even more acute than with many non-communicable diseases: While more-advantaged individuals wait out infection at home, the response evolves, clinical management of infection improves, and case-fatality rates fall, allowing these groups to sidestep the worst effects almost entirely while minoritized and poorer groups take the brunt of infection and death4,28. Including mechanisms of social and economic dependence in exposure, i.e. the ways in which one group’s increased exposure facilitates the decreased exposure of another, is essential for transmission models to be useful tools for identifying and mitigating inequity. 3. The same structural factors drive inequity across multiple infectious disease outcomes. The social factors that drive risks for one infection are likely to influence others. The immediate toll of COVID-19 mortality has disproportionately affected low-SES and minority communities. However, emerging evidence suggests the risk of a ‘double jeopardy’ effect: those communities where hospital systems were overwhelmed, already-insufficient primary care fell behind, and where children were unable to keep up with routine immunizations, are now at risk of outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, pertussis and others. In addition, risk factors for COVID-19 strongly overlap with those for infections such as tuberculosis, influenza, fungal infections such Coccidiomycosis,31 HIV/STIs, and others. Vaccine hesitancy, which has been more pronounced among lower SES populations, and poor access to prevention and care also impact risk for multiple pathogens, and a higher prevalence of co-infections dramatically increases risks for poor outcomes including hospitalization and death. Consequently, models that account for potential ‘knock-on’ effects of one set of social causes on multiple disease outcomes - how the risks for SARS-CoV-2 are related to risks for influenza, other ARIs, HIV, and other infections - are critically necessary to assess the full scope of damage associated with upstream inequities. Conclusion A deeper integration of social-epidemiological and biological ideas in transmission models is urgently necessary. The challenge of this undertaking should not be under-stated, nor should the substantial contributions of transmission modelers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We echo the argument made by Bertozzi et al. in the early days of the pandemic29: rather than stumbling over attempts at hyper-realism, transmission models should focus on characterizing broad trends in inequity, the mechanisms that generate them, and multi-level interventions that might work to ameliorate infection inequities. We also should not pursue a single ‘correct’ model that includes all these mechanisms and outcomes at once. Instead, equity-forward models should be another element of the epidemiological toolkit, alongside their forecasting and predictive counterparts. The value of these models comes from their potential to force policymakers to justify their choices in terms of who is protected and who isn’t. Models that include the mechanisms of inequity as first-class citizens can be tools for achieving the social herd immunity described by Williams & Cooper9, but getting there will require a sober reckoning of how far we currently are from it. Without models that simultaneously speak the languages of transmission, evolution, and social stratification, structural changes that come from contesting power will once again be left out of the universe of possibilities that can be explored using transmission models. Including these mechanisms positions models - and modelers - to address\n6 questions of health justice early and often, instead of being on the margins. And by taking an active role in centralizing the structural drivers of inequity in risk - and acting upon that knowledge - modelers can lead the way in ensuring a better outcome for all in the next crisis.\n7 Figures & Tables",

    "text": "This dissertation aims at appraising the proposition of conferring international legal\npersonhood on Nature,1 as an alternative instrument to cope with the present ecological\ncrisis. It focuses on the transition from the object to the subject of law, namely from the\ntraditional Western worldview of understanding natural resources as goods, even as\ncommodities, chiefly represented by the contemporary notion of the human right to a healthy\nenvironment, towards the recognition of Nature as an entity endowed with rights.\nCorrespondingly, it deals with encouraging the participation of Nature as a new actor in the\ninternational arena, emphasising its intervention, particularly in green judgements before the\ninternational courts of justice. The jurisprudence coming from the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (CJEU) constitutes the referential case study.\nIn fairness, although the idea is not new at the national level and seems to resurface\nevery now and then,2 the scheme of Nature as a holder of rights merits further research and\ndevelopment. Indeed, the state of affairs has been significantly modified in the ordinary\ncourse of events, mainly because what was “ unthinkable ” in the past, before the U.S. courts,3\nhas become presently feasible before tribunals of New Zealand, Colombia, and India, which\nhave conferred legal personality on rivers and other ecosystems.4\nAlthough one of the first and most celebrated propositions about the recognition of\nrights of Nature is on the records of Sierra Club v. Morton , nay in the dissent opinion by\nJustice Douglas, the case also represented a relative judicial setback. It is due to the fact that\nthe Court of Appeals rejected the lawsuit, brought before it to prevent the construction of a\nski resort and its facilities on Mineral King Valley, holding that the claimant lacked legal\nstanding to claim on behalf of the ecosystem.5\nNevertheless, twenty years later, the community of Whanganui Iwi and the Crown of\nNew Zealand signed an agreement to discharge a long-running legal dispute, begun in 1990,\nwhich mainly focused on the creation of legal personality for the Whanganui River.6 On their\npart, Colombian Courts have been acutely active in recognising diverse ecosystems as\nsubjects of law and granting rights. In that regard, the Colombian Constitutional Court",

Indeed, the first formal acknowledgement of an ecosystem as\na person-endowed of rights-occurred in 2006, in Tamaqua Borough, Pennsylvania, by\nmeans of an ordinance relative to the ban on corporations from engaging in the land\napplication of sewage sludge.9 Thenceforth, a total of twenty-six towns in the United States\ncounts on similar bylaws, i.e., in addition to Pennsylvania, the states of Virginia, New\nHampshire, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Ohio, New Mexico, Idaho, Wisconsin, and\nCalifornia.10\nOn its part, Nature or “ Mother Earth ” is legally a “ collective subject of public interest ”,\nwho has rights to life, diversity of life, water, clean air, balance, restoration, and a life free\nof pollution in Bolivia.11 Meanwhile, in New Zealand, the 2012 agreement between Maori\npeople and the Crown of New Zealand was enacted into law in 2017, declaring the so-called\nTe Awa Tupua -the ecosystem linked to the Whanganui River -as a legal person.12 Finally, as\nthe corollary of the constitution-making process in Ecuador, Nature has the constitutional\nright to “integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its\nlife cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes ” since 2008.13",

Hereinafter Constitution of Ecuador.\nAll of these national experiences have led this question towards a new judicial, legal,\nand even ethical moment, in which will turn out crucial, at least, to contextualise the real\nscope of Nature, as a global entity, and reinforce the mechanisms allowing the\nimplementation of its legal representation systematically. In order to attain these ends, it will\nbe necessary to pose the dilemma of the bearer of rights since the perspective of international\nlaw. This single scenario is capable of encompassing the authentic physical extension of\nNature beyond the mere national boundaries.\nOn the other hand, the common thread running within this work will be property rights,\ngiven the remarkable role they played in the different dimensions of the debate about how\nto understand and address the current environmental emergency. Indeed, ownership of\nnatural resources quite probably represents the major criticism of anthropocentrism, being\ndeemed by its detractors as one of the chief sources of ecological depletion14 and social\nconflict.15 David R. Boyd himself, the current U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights\nand the Environment, has assured that “[a] nthropocentrism and property ‘rights’ provide the\nfoundations of contemporary industrial society, [where economic] growth is the principal\nobjective for governments and businesses, and it consistently trumps concerns about the\nenvironment ”.16\nNevertheless, there are also utterly contradictory criteria thereon, such as Cole’s or\nFlipo’s. So, Cole asserts that those views about property rights at the centre of environmental\nconcerns are too much reductionist since they do not take into account many other\ncircumstances involved, like institutional distortions, technological deficiencies, extremely\nhigh transaction costs, and so on. On his part, Flipo pleads the rights of Nature should\narticulate with human rights, given that both categories are not excluding. He believes\nNature’s rights, just like human rights, can get instrumentalised against those promoting\nselfishness surreptitiously and enforced against polluters and exploiters. “ Nature rights\nmight be enforced against the poor but not the rich, [he asserts] in a Malthusian approach,\njust as human rights can serve as a mask for ownership ”. Interestingly, Boyd himself quotes\na couple of judicial cases, albeit at the Constitutional level, recounting how certain courts,\nin Slovenia and Belgium, have not decided in favour of property rights and to the detriment\nof Nature, based predominantly on reasons of public interest.17",

In other words, it does not deal with that empirical definition of Nature,\nwherein environmental protection and its economic functions are correctly balanced, as\nargued by Sax, Hunter, and Rieser, even though in the end without brushing aside its legal\ncategory of commodity.18\nThe notion of rights rather involves bringing Nature further the limits of the paradigm\nof legality, and even of morality, overriding any loophole of ownership, in order to extend\nits ambit of lawful protection like any another existing subject of law, similarly-perhaps-to\nwhat has once occurred with slaves, women, workers or blacks, and so on.19 Around this\nreasoning, it arouses various enquiries that exceed the purely legal analysis and settle in the\nfield of other related disciplines, particularly ethics.

    "text": "Unquestionably, all current experiences about the recognition of rights of Nature and its legal\npersonality come from local legislation and national courts, as one can see in the United\nNations’ compilation. Nevertheless, Nature is comprehensive in practice, indivisible, as it\nwere. Territorial boundaries cannot separate the cycles of life, the structure, or the\nfunctioning of Nature. Its natural processes do not bring about isolated effects that one could\ndifferentiate by countries or regions. Evidently, those effects are global.21\nThus, albeit one should acknowledge the local experiences have been crucial to\npromoting this new paradigm, they will be merely isolated endeavours if one does not take\ninto account the wholeness of Nature. For example, the attempts to protect a transnational\nriver or any other similar ecosystem will not be fruitful while all countries involved do not\ntake the appropriate eco-friendly measures. The individual actions will be useless in the end.\nIn conclusion, lawmakers should design normative to respond to the totality, not to the\nparticularities, and the best fashion, quite probably the only one, to address those integral\nvisions of Nature is through international law.",

    "text": "21 Harmony with Nature (2020) § 1-23.\nThe scope of the legal, judicial, and ethical perspectives determined the methodology\nemployed in the present dissertation. In that regard, the traditional doctrinal method guided\nthe analysis of the legal and judicial components of the research, which corresponds to the\nclassic technique of analysing “ black-letter law ”, in the words of Paul Chynoweth. In general\nterms, following Jacobstein, Mersky, and Dunn, black-letter law deals with a colloquial\nexpression relating to “[...] the basic principles of law generally accepted by the courts\nand/or embodied in the statutes of a particular jurisdiction ”.22 Its application is going to\nallow counting on a systematic formulation of legal data about the international instruments\ncurrently in force, just like the academic works about the topic.\nAdditionally, the processes of collecting information, processing of data, ascertaining\nof facts, and analysis of results have followed the general steps explained in the literature\nthereon. Thus, as Van Hoecke describes, the relevance of each case determined the contents\nand the manner of collecting the empirical data which comprised mainly of the normative\nsources and case-law.23 Likewise, the quotation and report of various repealed European\ndirectives, for instance, corresponded to their level of importance concerning specific\njurisprudence.\nIn a similar vein, the guidelines for the interpretation of wording have been crucial to\nobtaining results, focusing primarily on the texts of the adjudications. The position of the\nCJEU is not always homogeneous so that it is necessary to determine the diverging readings\nabout the same norm, in order to interpret a potential opinion of the Court or its meaning\nconcerning this and that specific matter.\nFurthermore, one cannot lose sight of the uncertainty principle in legal research,\nparticularly in this kind of environmental studies, in which the replies are often interpretative\nand not definitively the simplest ones so that the results are far to be conclusive.24 In any\nevent, the comments, opinions, and arguments come from the highest possible number of\nsources and evaluations in order to correct, to the extent feasible, the errors or\nmisunderstandings derived from the uncertainty of data. By the way, Hoffman and Rumsey\nhave an accurate compilation of legal sources in several disciplines of law but mostly related\nto international environmental law.25",

Then, the\nemployment of concepts taken from different scientific disciplines has been inevitable,\nabove all, when they have been useful to avoid misinterpretations.26\nOn the other hand, the search for bibliographic information about the methods “ of”\nethics does not look like a difficult task at first glance. However, once one has undertaken\nthe quest, the lack of specific references is quite noticeable. The bulk of study materials\nrefers mainly to the role of ethics in the research of both sciences and humanities, evidently\nincluding law, emphasising the addressing of ethical challenges and dilemmas during the\nprocess of conducting research.27\nThus, when one reviews several works about applied ethics, including academic\ndissertations, they give the impression that authors take it for granted the analysis of moral\nprinciples should fit the traditional Western practices, namely they adopt those methods\ninfluenced mainly by Kant and his categorical imperative towards deontological enquiries.\nIn the course of the examination, however, it is common to be tempted to occasionally opt\nfor empirical analysis, assigning a greater weight to the behavioural observations and\npractices than the categories of thought. In contradistinction to what Kantianism states, it\noften occurs-for example-with generally accepted tenets like the precautionary principle,\nwhich differ from the aprioristic focus of the categorical imperative.28 It turns out trying to\ncontrast the persuasive scientific evidence through, so to speak, mere intuitions.\nIn the same line of reasoning, at the risk of being superfluous as suggested by Sidgwick,\nit has also been crucial to preventing certain casuistry that outweighs fundamental principles\nof ethics. The reason lies in the avoidance of obtaining misplaced results to the main\nobjective of this research, such as the responsibility of animals, promoted by utilitarianism,\nfor example. Incidentally, Peter Singer, one of the most prominent thinkers of contemporary\nutilitarianism, joint with his colleague Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek, affirmed that Sidgwick’s\nbook was the best on ethics ever written. Therefore, conforming to Katz, one has attempted\nto balance the metaphysical approach, as the “ proper” ethical method, with the tools of",

    "text": "In the framework of this analysis, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) got\nselected, heeding two key methodological reasons. Firstly, this choice allows the\nexamination of property rights on a broader scope, given the applicable normative, i.e., the\nTreaty of the European Union guarantees the right to bring legal actions not only to Member\nStates but also natural and legal persons. On the contrary, other tribunals instead restrict the\nright to participate as a party in a trial. For example, the International Court of Justice’s\nstatute limits the right to claim and counterclaim solely to the ambit of States, as already\nmentioned, which would circumscribe the range of the study merely to the field of the\nassumptions.30\nSecondly, the employment of jurisprudence coming from the CJEU reduces, at least in\npart, the biased criteria towards the human rights-based approach of the environmental\nmatters, particularly the right to a healthy environment. It does not mean that judicial\ndecisions issued by the international courts of human rights from Africa, America, or\nEurope, cannot be the object of study. Indeed, one could suggest future research addressing\nthe adjudications from those tribunals. Nevertheless, in this particular case, their exclusion",

The parameter of comparison is the total of environmental adjudications, issued\nby the CJEU. Furthermore, one can read the data displayed by the graph both in figures and\npercentages. Curiously, there was not a combination of those words in the judicial sentences\nbefore 1999.\nThus, in the analysis period, i.e., between 1999 and 2019, the green decisions\nrepresented an average rate of 7.8% in relation to the total selected ones. The highest\npercentage was recorded in 2015 (20.6%), while there was not any case in 2001 and 2002.\nAs a general remark, one can see the frequency of mentions is not significant in the function\nof the universe, not even when it reaches the peak level. Complementarily, the score of the\ncorrelation coefficient (r) is 0.419, meaning a weak interplay between both sets of data, given\nits level of closeness to 0. Consequently, these results are not determinant to establish an\ninterconnectedness, let aside any interdependence between “ property rights ” and\nenvironmental judgements.

    "text": "Effectively, the second curve contains a set of data constructed from the inclusion of\nadjudications that alluded to other words, such as “property”, “owner”, “proprietor”,\n“private”, and their linked terms (e.g., plurals, suffix and prefix in nouns, and so on).\nMoreover, the selection was validated through the contrast with other terminologies, such as\n“belong”, “possess”, “tenant”, and their linked expressions. Nevertheless, after the first\nreview in detail of documents, one can also notice the locution “economic interest(s)”\nfrequently refers to cases in which there is a tension between property rights and Nature so\nthat it was necessary to include those cases in the sample as well.\nThe upshot of this new stage of analysis was a corrected sample of 433 records. As one\ncan notice, the correlation between the number of cases containing references to property\nrights and the universe is severely much more persuasive than the last results, i.e., much\ncloser to 1 (r = 0.914) and a considerably highest rate of 44.9% concerning environmental\njudgements in the function of the totality. One can also corroborate the level of association\nbetween variables by observing the parallelism experience by the two curves. Although both\nlines flow through different ranges, they seem to follow similar dynamics together, deviating\nupwards and downwards at the same time.\nThis methodological procedure, however, brings about two practical issues to warn\ncarefully. Initially, the linguistic diversity of the Court’s decisions is a real hindrance to\ndetermining properly the sample, which reflects even in their English translations.\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020Number of Cases\nTotal Cases Property Lineal (Property)r= 0.914\nInconvenient handles of language also occur as a result of the ambiguity, imprecision,\ncontext-dependence, and other forms of the so-called “ linguistic vagueness and\nuncertainty ”, coming from the original national adjudications or the conflict between norms,\nderived from the “ value pluralism ”.37\nIn this line of reasoning, the word “ possess” does not always denote property,\nparticularly in the legal parlance. Nevertheless, the judgements in which it appears should\nnot be discarded in the first instance, owing to the fact that court members employ them\nunder the connotation of property. In Brady v. Environmental Protection Agency (2013) , for\none, judges are thoroughly aware that “ ownership ” and “possession ” are different concepts.\nIn contrast, in the preliminary ruling about the criminal case of Nilsson, possession is utilised\nas a synonym of “ property”. Curiously, none of the texts includes the term “ property”.38\nIndeed, one should not reject the words associated with the concept of property because it\nwould imply to run the risk of losing valid information.\nSecondly, the effect of this aggregation of data makes for another obstacle regarding the\ninsertion of useless or disjointed cases. Nonetheless, it is the lesser of two evils, given it\noccurs even with the term “ property” without others at stake. In Commission v. Alquitranes\nand others (2017) , for instance, the term “properties” is used in a scientific sense, like\n“physiochemical properties”. Likewise, the word “possess” is also employed within the same\ncontext. Consequently, after a review of terminology, this adjudication had to be formally\ndiscarded.39\nAdditionally, a clarification is thoroughly necessary at this point. The allusions\nconcerning property rights within the adjudications’ texts do not mean that either applicants\nor defendants are holders of ownership. In the very first stage, it barely implies the existence\nof some issue related to property rights. Thus, for example, in the request for a preliminary\nruling No. C-411/17, the reference about property rights has to do with Electrabel, the owner\nof two nuclear power stations, which is not a litigant of the leading dispute but an intervener.\nThe case regards the restarting of one nuclear power station of electricity’s production,\npreviously closed, and the deferral of the date initially set for deactivating the other.

Nevertheless, when one\ncarefully examines the adjudications’ texts, one figures out in the environmental parlance\nsimilar semantic obstacles to those identified in the preceding selection.\nUnsurprisingly, several Court’s decisions focus on a too extensive diversity of topics,\nincluding impractical and discardable material, so to speak, such as specific regulations of\nchemicals,41 payment of charges due to access to environmental information,42 conditions of\nimport of agricultural products,43 and so on.

Once again, the diversity of languages and their\ntranslations presumably impose restrictions on the choice, albeit this time it happens in the\nopposite direction. So many words are translated, for instance, as “ nature”, “environment ”,\n“land”, or “water” and their linked expressions. The extension of the sample dramatically\ngrows if terminologies about specific natural resources are also listed, for example, “ soil”\nand “forest” in addition to “ land” and “water”, among others.

Therefore, it gets recreated an equivalent hindrance of\nsystematisation to what occurred with the initial subject matter of “property rights”, i.e., they\nrepresent a too-small sample of the universe. The solution would be again the inclusion of\nother terms, which could imply a boomerang effect.\nTo recapitulate, one should be cautious enough to select the terminologies adequately\nfor the systematisation, carefully avoiding falling in the uncomfortable disjunctive between\nchoosing just one key term or all of them. While it is true that using only a single category\nof selection could lead to the omission of meaningful cases, the vagueness of the process of\naggregation distorts the sample sharply to the point of its futility instead.\nConsequently, the intermediate solution consisted of utilising two key expressions,\n“ecosystem(s) ” and “natural resource(s) ”, for the selection and starting from the final sample\nof property rights (i.e., the matrix with 391 records). The combination of both factors,\nconcepts, and cluster, brings about the duality between ownership and Nature that this\nresearch aims. Moreover, the procedure somehow conveys a message concerning natural\nresources as goods or commodities to possess, represent, or even protect.

It is indisputably evident that Nature is not a legal person. The\nlegal personality, indeed, has been historically reserved for States, although it has been\nprogressively getting extending to certain international organisations, and even individuals\nunder very special circumstances.45\nIn that sense, one should argue that environmental protection is governed under a\nthoroughly anthropocentric character at a global level, which is not really concerned with\nsafeguarding and respecting Nature in itself, but rather benefiting the best conditions for\nhuman life. In this line of thought, as Knox and Pejan state, “[...] healthy environment is\nnecessary for the full enjoyment of human rights and, conversely, the exercise of rights\n(including rights to information, participation, and remedy) is critical to environmental\nprotection ”.46\nConsequently, the central argument is aligned with the recurrent assertion that\nenvironmental protection laws have essentially failed because they are anthropocentric , i.e.,\n“[...] their goal is [as Laitos and Wolongevicz state] to protect and benefit humans, not the\nenvironment in which humans live [and] assume human superiority and exceptionalism to\nnature and natural processes ”, among other analogous reasons.47\nThe common thread running with this section will consist principally of determining\nwhat the implications are resulting from the anthropocentric management of Nature\nregarding its legal status. It embeds a deterministic approach to some extent, predicated on\nthe belief that the anthropocentric character of international law is ubiquitous, and\nsubsequently, its exercise could bring about potential environmental impacts everywhere.\nHence, the study pretends to reply to a couple of research questions. On the one hand,\nit will focus on establishing if the existing legal mechanisms are enough to protect and\nrespect Nature in itself, and not necessarily for human sake. And, on the other hand, it will",

These aspects get signified immediately from the first\nline in the initial precept: “ Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable\ndevelopment ”.48\nLikewise, the fight against desertification constitutes another clear-cut\nacknowledgement of anthropocentrism and human dominance over Nature, as the first\nrecital lays down explicitly: “[...] that human beings in affected or threatened areas are at\nthe centre of concerns to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought ”.49\nOn its part, the Aarhus Convention constitutes another straightforward illustration of\nlegal human-centred discourse in the branch of international law. From the outset, the\npreamble allows perceiving this tilt by recognising “[...] that adequate protection of the\nenvironment is essential to human well-being and the enjoyment of basic human rights\n[...]”.50\nIn the branch of international law, however, there are very few concepts so visibly\nanthropocentric such as the notion of human rights. And one of the most curiously\nconvincing manners of approaching environmental protection is precisely through human\nrights. This interconnection between both elements comprises the widely known “ human\nright to a healthy environment ”, which is, although it has not yet acknowledged in any\ninternational instrument at that level, quite probably one of the most spread concepts\nregarding environmental issues worldwide.",

    "text": "States have been deemed as the sole subjects of international law for a long time, not only\nfrom the perspective of the orthodox positivist doctrine51 but also from the diversity of more\nmodern developments.52 Furthermore, States usually accomplish the four traditional\nrequirements of international legal personality, established in the Montevideo Convention\non Rights and Duties of States of 1933, whose Article 1 provides that they should possess:\n(a) a permanent population, (b) a defined territory, (c) a government, and (d) capacity to\nenter into relations with the other states.53 Although this instrument is solely applicable to\nthe ambit of the American States, which are the signatory members, it is useful as a legal\nreference, having been even considered-as Shaw asserts-the most widely accepted notion\nof “statehood ” worldwide.54\nIn parenthesis, within this legal framework, one could argue that human beings and\nNature curiously occupy an equal hierarchical level before international law, given that both\nare constitutive elements of the State, i.e., population and territory. However, while humans\nhave reached nowadays certain doctrinal and even legal recognition as subjects of\ninternational law, Nature continues to be a set of things, susceptible to property. Their\ndiscursive and practical development before the law has been, therefore, unbalanced.\nEffectively, ancient dogmas have been experiencing shifts towards increasingly\ninclusive conceptions, which have given rise to the participation of greater numbers of actors\nin the international sphere, although with the exception of Nature. The way how jurists of\nthe “Law of Nations ”, an early way to call international law, used to address the expansion\nof legal personality from “ real subjects ” (i.e., states) towards the so-called “ apparent ones ”\n(i.e., confederations or insurgents)55 can be deemed somehow parallel to the current\nendeavours to incorporate in its scope to religious, political, and even commercial\ninstitutions.56 It certainly deals with a manner to overcome that kind of “ dogmatisms ”.

By the way, it is curious the parallelism with the aforementioned idea of “ ethical\nextensionism ”, studied in the chapter five.\nSomething similar has occurred in judicial practice, where States are not anymore the\nonly legal persons capable to bring a suit or be claimed. One of these cases is, for example,\nthe Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, whose article 3 (a) provides that\nthe Court of Justice of the European Union can “[...] rule on actions brought by a Member\nState, an institution or a natural or legal person ”.58\nNevertheless, one should also be aware of the existence of provisions in which the\nlimitation regarding the exclusive orbit of States keeps still in force. Effectively, this part of\nthe dichotomy could be exemplified through the Statute of the International Court of Justice\n(ICJ), whose article 34 (1) reads that “ Only states may be parties in cases before the Court ”,59\nan aspect that could be even seen as a lawful hindrance to look for judicial protection in\nfavour of Nature.\nAs it is alluded to, both in the ancient and contemporary scholar literature, there is a\ngeneralised acceptance that States do have international legal personality.60 Indeed, the\ntheoretical roots could be identified around the eighteenth century. Portmann explains that\nearly doctrinal developments concerning the interconnections among States could be traced\noriginally in the 1758 work by Emer de Vattel, Le Droit des Gens .

It occurs especially in order to undertake negotiations to\nprotect human rights. Although Mc Hugh and Bessler make clear that bargaining does not\nconfer legitimacy or recognition to armed groups, including terrorists or paramilitary\norganisations, they acknowledge that those negotiations “[...] a legitimate and appropriate\napproach to securing humanitarian outcomes ”. In matters of international law, Mc Hugh\nand Bessler allude to a provision thereon in the second additional Protocol of the Geneva\nConventions, which refers to “ dissident armed forces ”.73\nThe recognition in matters of humanitarian law virtually corresponds to stateless people\nor a diaspora of people whose personal status is governed by the country of their domicile\nor their residence, as appropriate, according to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of\nStateless Persons.74\nThe totality of examples is a potential subject of the extension of legal standing, or the\nlimits of legality have already extended to them in practice, which demonstrates the\nenormous dynamics of legal status. Following Portmann’s didactic categorisation, or even\nChen’s, one could affirm the legal considerability has expanded towards an increasing range\nof governmental, non-governmental organisations, business corporations, and individuals as\nwell. Furthermore, with their specific restrictions, one can argue they are “ legitimised ”\nmembers of the international community.75\nOne could even come to believe in the parallelism of this process with the extension of\nhuman rights. Still, it is necessary to be cautious enough to understand that both experiences\nare quite different in substance.

It has occurred, at least, with the ambit of institutions, at the private and public\nlevel76. Thus, their creation fundamentally aims at satisfying human needs.\nOn its part, the recognition of human beings as subjects of international law followed a\nquite different pattern. It was going to occur sooner or later, not only as an effect of the\napplication of that ideological factor coming from the “ Western, liberal-democratic\ntheory”77 but also because human beings are the real bearers of rights, materialised\nparticularly since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.\nTherefore, even though the role played by international entities in the global\nenvironmental field can have relevant repercussions, chiefly in the bargaining and adoption\nof more eco-friendly agendas and policies,78 and even more regarding their intervention in\nlitigation as parties or amicus curiae,79 the core defence of the human right to a healthy\nenvironment, sustainable development, and the rights of future generations should spring\nprecisely from individuals.\nHere is probably the main reason why internationalists have popularised the idea of an\ninterplay between human rights and the environment, affirming that the adverse impact on\nhuman living standards, derived from ecological degradation, has implied a serious threat to\nthe “[...] full enjoyment of human rights, [...] including the right to life, health, habitation,\nculture, equality before the law, and the right to property [,] as well as the achievement of\nsustainable levels of development [...]”.80\nIn any case, as one can see, no matter how elaborated the theoretical developments are,\nNature is completely outside the discursive considerations.

    "text": "Traditionally, the law has been divided into three branches: persons ( personas), things ( res),\nand actions ( actiones). Gaius himself, one of the most influential Roman jurists, wrote so in\nhis celebrated “ Institutes”, “The whole of the law by which we are governed relates either to\npersons, or to things, or to actions ”.81 Consequently, discarding the last category, if Nature\nis not a legal person-as it has been argued in the previous section-it will be necessarily\nconsidered a thing or an array of things.\nIn the Institutes, the conception of things is strongly anchored in the notion of\nownership. Both expressions look like synonyms in several sections of Gaius’ work or, at\nleast, one can affirm that property is part of the definition of the thing. So, for example, in\nthe § 1 of the Book II, one can read that “[...] the law of things [is] either subject to private\ndominion or not subject to private dominion ”. Indeed, this interconnection is addressed\nthroughout the whole document under diverse categories of things (public and private,\ncorporeal and incorporeal, mancipable and non-mancipable, etc.).82 A summary of the\nclassification of things, proposed by Gaius, is going to be shown in table # 2.\nNevertheless, it is not the only [ancient] case, in which this link between things and\nproperty appears. Effectively, in the Institutes of Justinian, released during the Sixth\nCentury, the essence of this connection remained intact, having experienced just a little\nchange of form regarding the names. In a certain way, it is an obvious upshot considering\nhis categorisation of things ( res) based on Gaius’ one. According to Justinian, things were\ncapable of private ownership ( in nostro patrimonio ) or non-capable of private ownership\n(extra nostrum patrimonio ). Additionally, under Roman law, some things belonged to all\nmen (communes ), to State ( publicæ), to no men ( nullius), and to corporate bodies\n(universitatis ).83\nLong after, in the year of 1265, in the “ Siete Partidas ” (Seven-part Code), for example,\none can find analogue regulations regarding the conceptual interconnection between things\nand property, above all when Alfonso X of Castile has asserted that there are differences\namong the “[...] things of this world; [...] and others belonging only to men; and others\nappertaining commonly to a city or village or castle, or any other place where men inhabit;",

Gaius (1904) 13\n82 ibid 122ff.\n83 Justinian (1941) 90.\nand others subjected to the individual property of every man; [...] and others that\ncorrespond to nobody ”.84 Once again, the property becomes somehow the axis of the\ndefinition of things.\nIn a certain way, the concept of things historically denotes property as a constitutive\nelement. It seems like the definition of “ thing” is not complete if one sets aside the question\nof ownership. There are not simply “ things”. Indeed, as one could see, even the Roman\nnotion of “ res nullius ” is often translated as a “[...] thing that can belong to no one; an\nownerless chattel ”.85 This issue is even clearer when one refers to “ goods” or “commodities ”.\nThis idea has remained until these days. According to a contemporary definition, taken\nfrom a dictionary form, a thing is the “[...] subject matter of a right, whether it is a material\nobject or not; any subject matter of ownership within the sphere of proprietary or valuable\nrights”,86 from which one can infer the idea of property as the historical link between\nsubjects and objects within the lawful sphere.\nNonetheless, it does not only occur within the academic field. It also happens inside\nsome national legal frameworks worldwide. For instance, if one takes a glance at the Second\nBook of the French Civil Code, currently in force, one can notice it is organised based on\nthis relationship. The very title states “ Of the goods and the different modifications of\nownership ”.87 In the same sense, one can find equivalent provisions regarding the liaison\nbetween things and property in several U.S. state laws, currently also in effect.88\nAnother example, although a little peculiar, is the German Civil Code, which describes\na “thing” under the following terms: “[o] nly corporeal objects are things as defined by law ”.\nDespite the notion of ownership is thoroughly excluded from the concept of “ thing”, its\nassociation appears some articles later, given its essential parts cannot be the subject of\nseparate rights. This is the case, for example, of the rights connected with the ownership of\nland. Those rights are part of the land.89\nAs far as the “ law of nations ” is concerned, well-known in the Roman world as “ ius\ngentium”, it seems that Gaius did not make any difference regarding the relationship between\nthings and property, despite the fact that he did emphasise the existence of certain\ndissimilarities between Roman and foreign laws. Gaius argued that “[t] he rules established",

The provisions about property rights,\ncoming from the regional conventions on human rights are barely a few examples.\nTo recapitulate, when one scrutinises the legal history of the property and things, it is\nvery possible to find ancient references, especially taken from Roman law, about the legal\nstatus of Nature and its components. There is not too much to debate thereon, however,\nbecause Nature has been a set of things throughout time.\nFrom the outset, Gaius himself had categorised animals and plants as things, getting\nlimited merely to describe specific rules for those contested cases involving the decision\nabout whom the property corresponded to. Thus, Gaius differentiated tame animals (e.g.,\ndogs, geese, oxen, horses, mules, and asses) from wild (e.g., bears, lions, pigeons, bees, and\ndeer) and semi-wild ones (e.g., elephants, camels, and peacocks), in terms of their capability\nof being transferred to the property of others. Domesticated animals were mancipable ( res\nmancipi) while the rest were not so ( res nec mancipi ).92 See table # 2 below.\nThe mancipation (from the Latin expression mancipation, meaning hand-grasp ) was a\nformal procedure of “ imaginary ” or “simulated ” sale of specific things, exclusive for Roman\ncitizens who had reached puberty. It consisted of a public pronunciation of a solemn\nstatement before, at least, five witnesses, aimed at formalising the purchase by passing the\nlegal title to the new owner, i.e., the transference of property.93 So, people used to follow\nthis legal procedure for the purchase and sale of tame animals.\nOn the other hand, Roman citizens did not follow this procedure in the case of wild or\nsemi-wild animals due to the fact that it was useless. According to Gaius, “[c] omplete\nownership in things not mancipable [used to be] transferred by merely informal delivery of\npossession (tradition), if they [were] corporeal and capable of delivery ”.94",

    "text": "From the perspective of Gaius, Roman law also ruled another kind of rights connected\nto property of animals, such as usufruct. In parenthesis, a specific provision regarding the\nformality of usufruct leads to thinking curiously that the author believed that slaves were\n[some kind of] domesticated animals. Indeed, the § 32 of the Book II reads: “ In slaves and\nother animals usufruct can be created even on provincial soil by surrender before a\nmagistrate ”.95 However, as Abel Greenidge-one of the interpreters of Gaius-suggests, one\ncannot judge the Roman system exclusively based on the theory of Roman slavery. Most of\nthe time, although slaves were considered goods, not persons, they had often a superior\nintelligence and culture than their masters. So, they were frequently “ active men of\nbusinesses” in practice.96\nLikewise, the Institutes referred to different ways of defining the property of plants,\nwhich was often associated with the ownership of lands. In some sections, for instance, one\ncan find regulations regarding the way to determine the property upon those trees and corn\nplanted or sown on their own land or even on other people’s soils.97\nThere were also rules concerning the ownership on derivatives of natural resources,\neither vegetal (such as oil, wine, and chairs coming from olives, grapes, and wood), or animal\n(e.g., wool coming from lambs, sheep, and some goats, as well as mead prepared from\nhoney), or even mineral (for instance, electrum manufactured with silver and gold, and used\nfor jewellery).98\nIn general, other natural resources, like light, air, and running water (included oceans)\nwere considered things belonging to all men ( res communes ), therefore incapable of\nappropriation. In contrast, there were some references regarding the property of lands, which\ncould be susceptible to both private and public dominium . However, they were even subject\nto the dominion of the emperor.99\nTo conclude, beyond the fact that the historical tracks allow supporting, without doubt,\nthe idea that Nature has been legally a set of goods, subject to property, they also confirm\nthe historical existence of a legal system, based on anthropocentrism. So, keeping in mind\nthat anthropocentrism has been mentioned as one of the direct causes of the current\nenvironmental crisis, this is the great paradigm that supporters of the rights of animals and\nNature are bringing into question through their theories, and whose shift has also been\npromoted. Here lies the legal transmutation of Nature from object to subject of law. This\nchange would mean a quantum leap from an exclusively human-centred perspective towards\nanother different, founded on either living beings [biocentrism] or the ecosystem\n[ecocentrism], as appropriate.",

Firstly, they could search for an obvious way out, keeping\nthings ongoing, i.e., without changing anything. This alternative has been called “ public trust\ndoctrine” and has been employed mainly in the U.S.A. as a mechanism against the depletion\nof natural resources. The core idea is that Nature continues to be a set of things, although\necologically protected by a steward, curator, or representative, who usually is the State.\nSecondly, from biocentric tendencies, it has aroused the possibility of granting legal\npersonality to non-human individuals, i.e., essentially animals. Both sentientism and\nanimalism are just a couple of doctrinal positions supporting this possibility. And, finally,\nthere is a holistic position of recognising the rights of Nature as a whole, and not individually.\nThese theories are known as ecocentric ones.

There is not yet a\nconsensual definition of the relationship between human rights and the environment. Indeed,\nreaching an accord concerning its academic content constitutes one of the most demanding\nchallenges. As suggested by Bruce Ledewitz, the reason would mainly lie in its vagueness\nand unrestrictive use, either in speculative or authoritative writings.105 In that regard, this\nrelationship usually appears as the right to a healthy environment, environmental right, or\nthe right to environment.106 Nevertheless, when scholars refer to the connotation of “ right”-\nit is worth clarifying-they often use it in the overall semantic sense of “[a] legally\nenforceable claim that another will do or will not do a given act [or] a recognized and\nprotected interest the violation of which is a wrong ”.107\nA frequent divergence about the contents of the right to a healthy environment consists\nof a duality between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric inferences. Consequently, the\nformer corresponds to a clearly human-centred vision, usually encompassed by the United\nNations and various scholars.108 It deals with the idea “[...] that a healthy environment is\nintegral to the full enjoyment of basic human rights, including the rights to life, health, food,\nwater and sanitation, and quality of life ”.109 It plainly means that a sound environment\nnecessarily constitutes a prerequisite to the exercise, or even the satisfaction, of the other\nhuman rights. Consequently, the protection of Nature is not transcendent in itself. Its\nusefulness aims at guaranteeing the quality of natural resources for humanity’s benefit. On\nthe other hand, the latter contains a non-anthropocentric bias, which could be better\nexplained through Ledewitz’s argument, as follows:",

Quoted also by Leib (2011) 91.\nLedewitz’s definition is significant since it avoids a thoroughly anthropocentric\npartiality. When the author claims for a “ planet that has not been unalterably changed by\nman”,111 he demands the integrity of the world and humankind altogether. In this manner,\nthe right to a healthy environment does not focus on an exclusive search for human benefit.\nIt does not only deal with the availability of natural resources (e.g., clear air or pure water),\nbut it also refers to the ecological wellbeing. Thus, it turns out evident his argument shifts\naway from the traditional idea of human rights, i.e., from the visible prone to look for solely\npeople’s welfare.\nOne of the scholars who have someway supported this stance is Louis Kotzé. From the\nperspective of ius cogens, he confirms the environmental wellbeing sometimes also goes for\nnon-humans, albeit admitting the existence of disagreements in this respect.112 In point of\nfact, this favouritism, understood within the logic of the human rights doctrine, possesses\npassionate defenders and severe detractors. In the realm of both the theorists and the\npractitioners, for example, it has repeatedly generated a heated debate concerning the\nanthropocentric dimensions.113\nNevertheless, one should also say that Ledewitz keeps an instrumental point of view in\nfavour of humans in a certain sense, above all, when he reaffirms that current and future\ngenerations are entitled to have that healthy environment. In discursive terms, it is still a\nhuman right more than Nature’s one. Moreover, when Ledewitz mentions the way how Bill\nMcKibben raised this entitlement in a modern context, he seems to suggest the right to a\nhealthy environment determines human domination over the earth.114\nBeyond the discourse, either anthropocentric or non-anthropocentric, it seems to\nunderlie a sort of contradiction amid the approaches of environmental protection and human\nrights. In effect, if the principal aim of ecological rights is people’s benefit, welfare will be\nonly possible through the use and enjoyment of natural resources. In other words,\nenvironmental protection will be necessary to provide clean air, drinking water, safe\nnourishment, and other standard living conditions. In this way, Nature becomes the supplier\nof goods and services that allows meeting the human needs. So, without natural resources,\nthere is no welfare for people. It is precisely around this kind of reasoning that the need for\nenvironmental protection arises, but also the ambiguities and paradoxes.",

In the original context, McKibben refers to his previous work, The End of Nature as\n“[...] an early attempt to show that human beings now dominate the earth ”. See McKibben (1998) 65.\nNevertheless, despite the increasing criticism regarding its efficacy in practice,\nespecially within the legal realm and public policy, its successful spread all over the world\nturns out undeniable due to a couple of potential reasons. Firstly, the pre-existence of the\nhuman rights system, widely accepted by the international community, does not imply any\nfurther elaboration of new postulates, either theoretical or empirical. It would often be\nnecessary only a re-definition of existing human rights, aimed at including the environmental\nvariables into their scope. Secondly, conceptualising ecological protection as a human right\nentails somehow maintaining the status quo of legal personality, namely States and other\nactors of the international sphere will continue to be the subjects of law, while Nature will\nremain as a set of goods. Of course, there is a greening of the discourse and legislation,\ninclined towards the protection and respect of natural resources. Although in the end,\nhowever, the utmost aim seems to be the guarantee of human benefit. Indeed, remarkable\nand globally broadcast definitions, such as sustainable development and rights of the future\ngenerations, are somehow derived from this rights-based approach.\nTo sum up, various authors consider environmental welfare as a right, even as a human\nright, whose implementation would be a useful mechanism to protect Nature. According to\nPrudence Taylor, the rights-based approach focuses on analysing environmental protection\nfrom a threefold perspective of rights: substantive, procedural, and adequately human\nones.115 Some other authors share this categorisation under more or less the same terms.116\nThe next pages contain a description of all these categories.",

She mainly adduces a lack of clarity regarding the relationship\nbetween human rights and environmental protection.120\nAlthough Birnie, Boyle, and Redgwell do not employ exactly the same structure of\nTaylor’s analysis, they do share her stance on this point. They speak about the greening of\nexisting human rights, despite the fact that there is not any independent “ right to a decent\nenvironment ” within international law. Thus, they recommend a derivation from other\nexisting rights, emphasising the rights to life, private life, property, and access to justice. To\nthem, the virtue of looking at environmental protection through other human rights\ninterestingly lies in that this interpretation “[...] focuses attention on what matters most: the\ndetriment to important, internationally protected values from uncontrolled environmental\nharm”.121\nOn her part, Linda Leib describes this process as the “ theory of expansion ”, namely the\neco-friendly interpretation of a group of well-established human rights aims to expand its\nrange until encompassing an environmental scope, beyond the mere human interests. She\nargues that these [fundamental] rights are “ derivative ” and thus they can be invoked within\nthe environmental context.

Indeed, one can also find inside her work the emphasis on the role of\nprocedural rights on empowering individuals, communities, and the civil society itself, to\ncombat environmental impacts and influence public decisions and policies regarding\nenvironmental matters. Indeed, the author considers empowerment as one of the most\nsignificant benefits derived from the implementation of environmental procedural rights.\nSimilarly, she believes that “[...] environmental issues should not be left to the discretion of\ngovernments ”, remarking the increasing level of independence of other actors to exercise the\nrights of information, participation, the search of redress, and the like.131\nNevertheless, her major contribution undoubtedly consists of linking “ democratic\ngovernance ” with “ecological sustainability ”. For this reason, Leib speaks about the\n“Environmental Democracy Theory ” from the outset132. In this regard, both Principle 10th of\nthe Rio Declaration and the Aarhus Convention are crucial to the recognition of procedural\nrights. Effectively, civic participation, access to information, intervention in decisionmaking, and access to judicial and administrative proceedings, established within the Rio\nDeclaration,133 constitute a decisive political framework (while not binding) to develop the\ntheoretical grounds of democratic participation and governance in environmental matters.\nThe idea is the exercise of these rights would support a more equal interplay among people,\nStates, and other institutional actors of the international arena, in practice. Likewise, being\npart of the Aarhus Convention, the rights to access to and collection of environmental\ninformation, public participation, access to justice, and so forth,134 constitute the explicit\nrecognition of the enforcement that procedural rights have within the international legal\nframework and, therefore, one of the unique instruments on global environmental\ndemocracy.\nOne last important aspect that should be stressed from Leib’s arguments refers to avoid\nthe perception that substantive and procedural rights could be seen as substitutes in practice.\nThey are conceptually different, and they often are addressed separately, as Leib and other\nauthors usually do.135 Other researchers, however, see both rights as complementary ones.\nCullet, for example, puts forward the use of proceeding rules of human rights, but along with",

In\nher view, it even represents one of the most progressive arguments in the context of the\ninterplay between human rights and environmental protection144. Taylor is plainly conscious\nabout the lack of regulations on environment, from the perspective of human rights, at a\nglobal level. Indeed, she explicitly mentions this peculiarity in her work “ An Ecological\nApproach to International Law ”, especially regarding the United Nations’ instruments145.\nThus, the probable reason why she prefers attributing the notion of an environmental human\nright to customary law would lie in the fact that it does not exist in legal practice.\nIn effect, despite the right to a healthy environment has not been yet explicitly\nrecognised within any international instrument at a global level, it perhaps represents the\nmost successful case of “ lawful universalisation ” through national legislation. Both Knox\nand Boyd point out that around 100 countries have currently included this right in their\nconstitutional frameworks, and more than 150 nations have recognised it inside their legal\nsystems, having increased this tendency mainly during the last years of the twentieth century.",

Some constitutions provide\ngovernment duties to protect Nature, or both aspects (entitlements and obligations)\nconcomitantly. From the perspective of the global environmental constitutionalism, as some\nauthors have labelled it, one should deem “[...] there is general agreement that no global\n(environmental) constitution or clear, self-standing international environmental right\nexists”, such as Kotzé holds. Global constitutional provisions “[...] lie scattered across the\nglobal regulatory domain [...]”. Therefore, he, joint with May and Daly, coincide that\ninternational environmental law is mostly soft.147\nUnder these circumstances, it turns out crucial what Dawson calls the “ constitutional\ndialogue”, understood as “[...] a deliberation between the legislative and judicial branches\nover how constitutional commitments and general political objective can be integrated ”\namong countries. The dialogue will allow each constitutional court or tribunal gives an\nauthentic interpretation of the right to a healthy environment, sharing their experiences with\nother international judicial forums and courts, and supporting the construction of an\nappropriate institutional system. Thus, for example, Boyd has pointed out some countries\nwhose constitutions contain no provisions concerning the right to a healthy environment, but\nwhose courts have ruled it is implicitly part of the right to life. Those countries are\nBangladesh, El Salvador (limited to children), Estonia, Guatemala, India, Israel, Italy,\nMalaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.\nTo some extent, it turns out intriguing that the right to a healthy environment have not\nreached explicit world recognition yet. It turns out somehow inexplicable, having\nexperienced abundant global diffusion, along with profuse environmental literature\ndedicated to it.148 Both issues are undoubtedly a thought-provoking measure of its growing\nimportance. John Knox himself, the former U.N. Special Rapporteur in this matter, has\nrecommended to the General Assembly the official recognition of the right to a healthy\nenvironment at the world level. Moreover, as part of an interview, he has hold that “[p] erhaps",

The rights to life and freedom can be examples. The second generation refers to\nthe social, economic, and cultural rights, such as health and education, for instance, which\ndo require the state intervention to be implemented. Finally, in addition to the right to a\nhealthy environment, the third-generation rights are generally comprised of the rights to\ndevelopment, peace, and ownership of the common heritage of humanity.152\nLikewise, as previously also uttered, one cannot refer to an exhaustive list of thirdgeneration rights, given they have not been yet “ formalised ”, so to speak, in international\nlaw. As Kotzé explains, not even the United Nations General Assembly, to which he terms\nas the “final arbiter on the formal creation and inclusion of international human rights ”, has\nbeen able to pave the way for their proclamation utilising a binding instrument on a planetary\nscale.153 In the aftermath, this lacking formalisation has spawned-as one could suppose-a\nbroad field for different theoretical approaches and diverse legal interpretations.\nSo, for example, Burns Weston particularises the right to development in economic and\nsocial terms, and does the same with the common heritage of mankind at mentioning\nexclusively the participation and benefit in “[...] shared Earth-space resources; scientific,\ntechnical, and other information and progress; and cultural traditions, sites, and\nmonuments ”. Additionally, Weston includes expressly the rights to political, economic,\nsocial, and cultural self-determination, likewise the humanitarian disaster relief.154\nIn perspective, each generation of rights got inspired by the three pillars of the French\nRevolution, i.e., liberté, égalité and fraternité , as appropriate, where the first category could\nbe seen fundamentally under an individualist dimension, the second one under the umbrella\nof an idealistic social scope (somehow as a kind of transition to the next group), and the last\none characterised by an apparently collectivist facet.\nTo Taylor and Weston, whose views in this point attach great importance to the\nobjective of the present study, Vašák’s proposal follows a chronological path. Thus, the firstgeneration rights arose from the ideologies concerning the liberal individualism and\neconomic laissez-faire , propounded mainly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\nThe second-generation rights emerged initially been from the socialist traditions in the early\nnineteenth century. Nonetheless, one should also say they became a claim coming from the\ndeveloping countries during part of the twentieth century. Finally, the third-generation rights",

According to Knox\nand Pejan, this last statement seems to be accurate, particularly in the case of the right to a\nhealthy environment. Indeed, as mentioned, its contents are not yet part of the international\nbinding framework.156\nIf one profoundly scrutinises this historical trail of human rights, one will notice the\nsomehow systematic inclusion of new entitlements in the social sphere. It has happened\nbeyond the chronological order and the correspondence to one or another period. Firstly, the\ncivil and political rights appeared and later the social, economic, and cultural ones. Yet the\nlatter did not replace the former, but rather both categories get gathered. Ultimately, the\ncollective rights came, but neither have they substituted the previous ones. Instead, they were\nalso included in the discursive range of human rights. Some authors, such as Weston, have\ncome to affirm that collective rights are interconnected with the other two dimensions of\nrights or even represent a reconceptualisation of them.157 Notwithstanding, the truth is that\nthese assertions are purely interpretative because the three categories have kept their\nconceptual independence among them.\nInterestingly, Imre Szabo shows a similar interpretation. For him, the historical\ndevelopment of the collective rights has occurred at the expenses of the individual ones, the\nonly two categories of citizens’ rights he genuinely admits. “ What was involved here [Szabo\nalleges] was a development which, historically, led, concomitantly with the development of\nsociety, to the extension of collective rights at the expense of individual rights ”.158 This\nmanner of describing the gradual establishment of the collective rights, and the particular\nallusion to the word “ extension ”, fits quite appropriately with the ethical connotation of\nextensionism, especially in terms of method. Indeed, one could affirm that the extensionism\nof rights constitutes a methodological strategy for granting different degrees of moral and\nlegal importance to specific beings. It has made it possible to bestow rights on actors who\nhave been historically isolated from legality and morality, such as slaves from the\nanthropocentric perspective, or animals from the utilitarian one.",

The new social conditions make it increasingly\ndifficult for alone persons to exercise their rights exclusively by themselves. In consequence,\nthe author expounds fellow collaboration [solidarity] has become unavoidable. Moreover,\nalthough the joint exercise of rights does not mean that people lose their individuality, it does\nrequire a minimum level of association. From a more lawful viewpoint, the author even\nhighlights the role of the “ cooperation ” of the social group as the only manner to exercise\nsolidarity rights.159\nBeyond the pertinence of Szabo’s examples, there are some cases accurate enough to\nillustrate solidarity in matters of rights. The repercussions of air pollution, for instance, could\ndescribe pretty efficiently the effect of collective rights over time, particularly in the context\nof the right to a healthy environment. At the outset, an isolated effort to prevent or, at least,\nhindrance a particular source of carbon emissions could be momentous, mainly for whom\nhas been directly affected as a consequence. Nevertheless, those isolated attempts will get\nincreasingly useless over time because the effects of air pollution are both cumulative and\nimpossible to converge statically within a specific area. The pollutants spread in the\natmosphere through the wind, by which harmful impacts can also occur far beyond the\nsource. Under these circumstances, the personal exercise of environmental rights and\nreparation of focused damages, exclusively in favour of affected people, turn out insufficient.\nIt would be necessary a joint action for encompassing the emergence of new indirectly\naffected people because their identification is quite complicated most of the time, namely\nindividuals do not lose their right to claim for damages, although they have to count also on\na recourse to defend the collective right of the group. Thus, roughly speaking, solidarity\nrights tend to work out around this purview.\nThe precedent reasoning leads to imagine that the right to a healthy environment has\nalso responded to the same historical track of collective rights. The association between\nenvironmental protection and human rights has sprung from an individual dimension which\nnow coexists with the collective one, giving rise to a normative dualism. Therefore, its scope\nis not exclusively restricted to the realm of collective rights or excludes each dimension from\nthe other.

Instead, one should highlight their particular relevance, chiefly in the\nempirical ambit.\nTherefore, Vašák indicates that these third-generation rights entail a life in community,\nwhich could solely be achieved by the agency of the “ combined efforts of everyone”,\nincluding individuals, public and private institutions, and states.160 A conventional\ninterpretation of his words seems to have a twofold character, concerning the collective\nperspective and the international one. Therefore, the idea of solidarity-consisting of the\nassistance of several actors to achieve life in community-is entirely holistic. Meanwhile, the\nintervention of different states denotes an evident idea of internationalisation. Weston does\nnot only agree with this argument but upholds that both features are interconnected. To him,\nthe cooperation among all social forces to attain the life in community drives directly to a\n“planetary scale ”, predicated on the search of generalised community interests.161 In any\ncase, the comprehensive logic behind the interconnection between both elements turns out\nunderstandable, being tight in practice admitting any argument in contrast. Environmentally\nspeaking, there is no probably anything more all-inclusive than the very planet.\nIn one way or another, the holistic sphere in which the collective rights to a healthy\nenvironment are unfolding gives rise to thinking about certain parallelism with the rights of\nNature, the core of this research. Therefore, one should take into account that, although they\nhave various aspects in common, both categories are fundamentally dissimilar as far as their\nphilosophical bedrocks are concerned. In effect, while the former sturdily found on\nanthropocentric stances, where humans are at the centre of everything, as the most important\nbeings, the latter are conceived under ecocentric criteria, where humans are other more\nfellows equal to the rest of the creatures.\nThe differentiation between both approaches is crucial in so far as their philosophical\npatterns are distinct, that is, the anthropocentric view is substantially individualistic as it\nrefers only to human beings. Meanwhile, the ecocentrism is holistic as it represents a more\ncomprehensive view regarding other nonhuman fellows. So, they are in antipodal directions.\nIn consequence, although a good number of authors correctly refer to the solidarity rights\nunder a holistic approach, they rather belong to an individualistic perspective, derived from\nhuman rights doctrine.

To comprehend how fresh it is, in principle,\none should bear in mind that both the right to a healthy environment and the right to property\nare considered human rights. Nevertheless, while the latter was expressly proclaimed\nworldwide by means of the Universal Declaration of 1948,163 the former barely appeared as\nsuch in the World Conservation Strategy (WCS) of 1980.164 Even though the Strategy is\nundoubtedly a valuable document in the environmental sphere, however, it does not stand\nfor the same transcendence as the Universal Declaration. Indeed, the WCS resembles more\na scientific report than a statement of principles.\nConsequently, one could easily imagine there are no explicit references about the right\nto a healthy environment in any of the analysed instruments, especially in those that form\npart of the International Bill of Rights. Even so, various authors have elaborated their legal\nhypotheses, predicated particularly on the interpretation of the Economic Covenant, whose\nconcept of environmental hygiene165 somehow epitomises the dawn of the environmental\nrights in the field of international law.\nIn context, the right to a healthy environment is often assumed as an extension of the\n“inherent right to life ”, closely connected with health, wellbeing, and the like. Indeed, the\nU.N.

In effect, human life would not be feasible without\naccomplishing minimum standards of exogenous components (e.g., clean air and water,\navailability of natural resources, suitable climate settings, and so on). And, as one can notice,\nthose exogenous components only could be handled through environmental parameters. By\nway of explanation, professors Alfredsson and Ovsiouk expound that “[...] the realization\nof certain well-established rights, such as those relating to life, food, health, and\ndevelopment, only to mention examples, is inherently dependent on the successful\nmanagement of the environment. The right to life is especially dependent on [a] sound\nenvironment ”.168\nIf one applies the same logic of thought to the realm of international law, the starting\npoint would be the acknowledgements of the rights to life and to a standard of living adequate\nfor the health and well-being, included in the Universal Declaration. Subsequently, this right\nto life should extend towards “[...] the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living\nfor himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the\ncontinuous improvement of living conditions ”, recognised by the Economic Covenant.169\nConcomitantly, the Economic Covenant also focuses on the “ right of everyone to the\nenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health ”, which\nconstitutes living conditions as well, liaised with human welfare. Eventually, it turns out to\nbe the link with the right to a healthy environment, given that one of the “ steps” required to\nachieve the full realisation of the alluded right consists precisely of: “ The improvement of\nall aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene ”.170\nTo recapitulate, chart # 6 illustrates the expansion of the right to life towards the right\nto enhance environmental conditions in the international legal framework, just as the authors\nexplain it within the academic field. In methodological terms, this process of expansion\nwould turn out to be a mechanism employed to obtain a substantive reinterpretation of preexisting human rights, intended to regulate the environmental sphere, as already seen in the\nprevious subsection.",

Firstly, it is worth emphasising the\ninstrumental, maybe even anthropocentric, features of the standards of living, whose\ncontents focus primarily on commodities (e.g., food, clothing, and housing) and services\n(e.g., health) coming originally from natural resources, that is, there is a connotation of\nNature as a supplier of goods and services.\nSecondly, the interrelation between adequate living standards (e.g., physical and mental\nhealth, food, clothing, and housing) and the enhancement of ecological conditions (i.e.,\nenvironmental hygiene) could consist of a valid premise per se in favour of the planet, and\nconsequently makes up an appropriate atmosphere to live. Nevertheless, this line of\nreasoning is unquestionably anthropocentric and represents the essence of the right to a\nhealthy environment.\nIn other words, the environmental improvement it is not beneficial for any ecosystem in\nitself, but only in the function of human welfare. Thus, the Convention to Combat\nDesertification includes an explicit legal example, when it states that the combat of\ndesertification and the mitigation of the effects of drought involve, inter alia, concentrating\non “leading to improved living conditions ”. Within this framework, the support of research\nactivities is intended “[...] to the identification and implementation of solutions that improve\nthe living standards of people in affected areas ” as well.171\nMoreover, although the amelioration of the environment possesses a broader legal and\ndiscursive scope than the improvement of living conditions in principle, the structure of the\nEconomic Covenant’s text does not describe this interplay. Indeed, it sets out an upsidedown depiction, i.e., the better living standards do not favour a clean ecosystem but quite\nthe opposite. The enhancement of all aspects of environmental hygiene implies just one of\nthe steps to reach the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Thus, if one\nscrutinises the other actions proposed by the covenant in the same provision, one will notice\nall refer to human-centred measures, namely (i) the reduction of the stillbirth-rate and infant\nmortality, (ii) the prevention, treatment, and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and\nother diseases, and (iii) the creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service\nand medical attention in the event of sickness.172 Each one aims at achieving the full\nrealisation of physical and mental health.\nFrom this point on, one can count on a series of theoretical nuances and legal examples\nregarding the expansion of the right to a healthy environment. Thus, for instance, Susana\nBorràs suggests an alternative interpretation, skipping over the alluded methodological\nprocess and going directly to the association between the right to life and the enhancement\nof environmental conditions. She argues that Article 6 of the Political Covenant “[...]\nexpressly identifies the need to improve the environment as a requirement for the proper\ndevelopment of the individual ”.173\nNotwithstanding, if truth be told, a simple first reading of the passage does not allow\nunderstanding of Borràs’ argument entirely. Hence, Alfredsson and Ovsiouk display a more\nintelligible explanation instead. They start from the HRC’s opinion regarding the fact that\nthe right to life is narrow and immediately link it with Article 6 of the Political Covenant.\nTo them, “[...] political rights, popular participation, fair trial and procedural guarantees\nare respected in the process of making policies and taking decisions relating to the\nenvironment ”.174 Consequently, the alluded civil and political rights recreate the necessary\nstandards to improve environmental conditions, and vice versa.",

Therefore, if Article 6 proclaims that every human being has the\ninherent right to life, one should consider its exercise requires the accomplishment of certain\nconditions, which condense into the set of civil and political rights, among others. In\nconsequence, “[...] the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom [...]\ncan only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and\npolitical rights, as well as his economic, social and cultural rights ”.175 Those are the\nadequate living conditions, which include the eco-friendly ones.\nOn her part, Audrey Chapman believes in an utterly opposite interpretation regarding\nthe covenants’ contents, in essence, a restrictive one instead of an expanding one. Hence,\nshe proposes to impose limitations on state actions when they are hurtful with Nature. This\nconstraint consists of combining the right to enjoy and utilise fully and freely the natural\nwealth and resources with the prohibition to deprive people of their means of subsistence.\nAdditionally, Chapman considers that certain rights, such as environmental hygiene, work\n(including favourable labour conditions), and an adequate standard of living “ may be\ntapped” for the substantive reread and reinterpretation of existing provisions, in which there\nare no explicit references to environmental issues.176",

Nevertheless, it curiously follows an inverse\nline of reasoning, namely it does not deal with the improvement of living conditions to\nenhance the environment or vice versa, but instead with the deterioration of ecosystems that\naffects the living conditions. To a certain degree, one can assert that the right to a healthy\nenvironment somehow hides within the definition of “ adverse effects of climate change ”. In\nother words, there is an association between exogenous (weather) and endogenous (health\nand welfare) elements that influence human beings and their living conditions.\nAs far as the explicit allusions to right to a healthy environment, or in its synonymous\nexpression “ sound environment ”, is concerned, one should argue they deal solely with a\nsuperficial approach. If one reads the contents of the conventions on access to information\nand biodiversity thereon, one will undoubtedly notice they are more rhetoric statements than\nregulations in practice. Annexe # 3.1 shows up a schematic abridgement regarding all\ninstruments.\nOn the other hand, various regional instruments on human rights also include allusions\nto the right to a healthy environment. The first and foremost aspect is worth highlighting\nconsists of all quoted instruments associate suitable environmental conditions with adequate\nliving standards. Thus, for instance, although one could argue that “ general satisfactory ”,\n“safe”, “clean”, or “healthy” are qualifiers with distinct scopes, all of them eventually denote\nthe need to improve the existing environmental conditions.\nIn a similar vein, despite the divergences among the approaches of “ development ”,\n“well-being ”, “decent life ”, or “human dignity ”, it turns out undeniable they all intend to\nobtain an amelioration of living standards. However, those living standards depend more or\nless explicitly on the provision of goods and services, such as food (livelihood), clothing,\nhousing (habitat or home), public services (education, health), and the like. Thus, the\nregional instruments on human rights also conceptualise the idea of Nature as a supplier of\ngoods and services (anthropocentrism). Annexe # 3.2 shows a summary thereon.\nFrom all these mentioned concepts, the notion of “ development ” is quite probably the\nbroadest and the most abstract in terms of scope. Indeed, the very African Charter defines it\nthroughout economic, social, and cultural dimensions.177 For this reason, it does not weird\nthis expression denotes an idea of national welfare instead of individual benefit for an\nindividual person or set of persons.

Nonetheless, if one painstakingly ponders the regional\ninstruments thereon, it is quite probable to read between the lines that the betterment of living\nconditions is feasible without considering any environmental amelioration, but the opposite\ndoes not occur. Thus, there is no room for ecological enhancement without human benefit.\nIt eventually means the existence of a hierarchical relationship between humans (including\ntheir living standards) and Nature.\nIn parenthesis, although sexist vocabulary of the international instruments is not part of\nthis research, it is worth mentioning it briefly due to it constitutes another manner of\nexclusion from the exercise of rights. In other words, international instruments somehow\nexclude from their ambit the environmental improvement when it does not promote human\nbenefit. Likewise, an exclusive male approach of language could exclude women from the\nexercise of human rights. There are some examples of thereupon.\nCuriously, both the Universal Declaration and the two covenants are littered with\nnumerous references to male expressions (e.g., he/his/him/himself), which would exclude\nexpressly to women from the exercise of specific rights. However, the bill of rights is not\nthe only case. This kind of allusion also appears in other regional instruments on human\nrights, such as the European Convention, the Pact of San José, the African Charter, and the\nArab Charter. Likewise, the CITES contains a couple of male mentions.\nBeing a relatively recent agreement, the 2004 Arab Charter probably represents a\ndifferent case among the indicated instruments due to its provisions could correspond to a\ndeep-rooted cultural worldview. Indeed, Louise Arbour, former U.N. High Commissioner\nfor Human Rights, has severely criticised the Arab Charter because of its inconsistencies\nwith international norms and standards, emphasising the lack of recognition of or poor\ntreatment of women’s rights. In consequence, one could argue this discriminatory text is\nonly a depiction of her concerns.179",

Hereinafter Arab Charter on Human Rights; UN\nNews (2008) paras. 1st and 2nd.\nThe other regional instruments on human rights and the CITES cannot be analysed under\nthe same terms instead, mainly because they were issued before the 1970s, except for the\nAfrican Charter (1981), when an equalitarian logic was not thoroughly spread worldwide.\nOne should consider, for example, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women came out barely in 1979. In this regard, if one reviews newer\ninstruments, one can notice they use both genres within their respective texts (i.e., he and\nshe, his and her, him, and her). The Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), the Aarhus\nConvention (1998), the Asian Human Rights Charter (1998), and the Charter of Fundamental\nRights of the European Union (2007) are examples.\nIn any case, to be fair, one should warn that some sexist expressions correspond to\nspecific languages and their translations. The elements of Nature get even classified\nfollowing the grammatical rules concerning the gender of things, objects, concepts, and so\nforth. Nevertheless, other languages, such as the Hungarian one, are examples of the fact\nthat there is no gender in all grammatical structures.\nWith hindsight, one could argue there is discursive supremacy of the adequate standards\nof living over environmental conditions. Indeed, if one scrutinises the semantic sense of the\nwriting coming from the instruments, especially the Economic Covenant, one can notice the\nimprovement of environmental conditions (hygiene) is instrumental, even functional, to the\nadequate standards of living.\nWithout a doubt, the explicit references to nourishment, attire, and housing, as patterns\nof acceptable living conditions correspond quite probably to a contextual issue of the\nemployed language. One should have in mind environmental concerns barely began to\nflourish and influence the legal parlance later in time (the early seventies).

Indeed, the 1972-Stockholm Declaration, considered by several\nscholars as to the starting point of the legal debate between environmental protection and\ndevelopment,191 illustrates it. Thus, the instrument redirects the discursive tensions between\ndevelopment and ecological protection towards human sake. One can explicitly read: “[...]\nStates should adopt an integrated and co-ordinated approach to their development planning\nso as to ensure that development is compatible with the need to protect and improve [the]\nenvironment for the benefit of their population ”.192\nIn the same line, the 1992-Rio Declaration, deemed as one of the cornerstones of soft\nenvironmental law, proclaims the anthropocentrism of sustainability by affirming that\nhuman beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. As has been the\ncase of the Stockholm Declaration, the association between ecological protection and\ndevelopment in the Rio Declaration turns out sort of indissoluble.

The writing of\nthis paragraph somehow connotes a pre-eminence of development over environmental\nprotection, given its broader scope. The notion of development makes up the whole, while\nenvironmental protection is merely one part. Furthermore, development could individually\noperate, unlike environmental protection.194\nThis kind of preference for development and human benefit over ecological issues does\nnot show up isolated merely in a few principles. On the contrary, the Rio Declaration is\nlittered with convergent aspects toward development, such as the alleviation of poverty, the\nelimination of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, the search of economic\ngrowth in all countries, and the participation of people (chiefly women, youth, and\nIndigenous). A relatively remarkable provision corresponds to the promotion of an open\ninternational economic system, highlighting the protection of international trade through the\nimplementation of policy measures, and even the provision of financial resources. In this\nframework, the instrument attaches particular importance to interstate cooperation and\ninterchange of technology and scientific knowledge, as mechanisms to attain global\nsustainability in its diverse nuances.195 In sum, as one can notice, this instrument favours a\nfull-blown anthropocentric discourse.\nNonetheless, the Rio Declaration was not the only lawful and discursive upshot of the\n1992-Earth Summit. The truth is that the conference gave rise to some of the most\nrepresentative international treaties in the subject matter in question. One of those\ninstruments was the Convention on Climate Change, whose predisposition towards\ndevelopment over the environment is also visible from the outset. Within the very preamble,\none can read that the responses to climate change should comprise social and economic\ndevelopment, chiefly oriented to the attainment of “ sustained economic growth ” and the\n“eradication of poverty ”. Moreover, the convention acknowledges the need to access to\n“resources required ” for reaching the mentioned sustainable social and economic\ndevelopment.196 In context, the use of the expression “ resources required ” is ambiguous,",

In either event, the question of sustainable use will get\nanalysed in the next chapter, apropos of property rights.197\nLikewise, the Convention to Combat Desertification states that “[...] sustainable\neconomic growth, social development and poverty eradication are priorities of affected\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, and are essential to meeting sustainability\nobjectives ”. Given there is no trace of any environmental aspect within this recital, despite\nthe fact that it theoretically forms a part of the concept of sustainable development, one can\nperceive an underlying anthropocentric connotation, which manifests through the exclusive\nemphasis on economic and human issues. Later in the text, the promotion of trade and the\neconomic environment as paths toward sustainability confirms the last assertion regarding\nthe prevalence of chrematistic and human elements over environmental ones. Thus, within\nthe realm of desertification and drought, the notion of sustainable development constitutes\nan achievement to meet in affected areas. Besides, it comprises the framework to formulate\nand implement strategies, priorities, programmes, plans, and policies to cope with this\necological problem.198\nWithin the framework of sustainability, the notion of economic development in the\ninternational legal parlance is of such magnitude that forms part of the general objective of\nthe Convention on Climate Change. Thus, it even states explicitly that “[...] economic",

In light of the\ntreaty, sustainable development constitutes a principle of cooperation to promote an open\ninternational economic system that would lead to “ sustainable economic growth ”. Indeed,\nthis instrument highlights “[...] the need to maintain strong and sustainable economic\ngrowth [...]”. Similar to the Rio Declaration, the Convention on Climate Change brings into\nquestion any restriction of international trade, no matter if that constraint aims at fighting\nagainst climate change. At this point, the contents of both instruments are virtually\nidentical.199\nCorrespondingly, the Convention to Combat Desertification also underlines the\nimportance of trade and economy within the ambit of sustainable development. Effectively,\nstate parties should give due attention “[...] to the situation of affected developing country\nParties with regard to international trade , marketing arrangements, and debt with a view\nto establishing an enabling international economic environment conducive to the\npromotion of sustainable development ”.200 It deals with an obligation intended to attain the\nobjective of combating desertification through the promotion of sustainability, which does\nnot incorporate any ecological variable, as it occurs in the rest of the treaties previously\ndescribed as well.\nThe trend towards standing out development over the environment does not seem novel\nor isolated. Thus, for example, Sachs and Bosselmann, among others have warned about a\nsort of gradual transmutation from the original essence of “ sustainability ” to the concept of\n“sustainable development”, especially since 1992. From then on, it “[...] seems to have lost\nits contours ”, Bosselmann argues. Furthermore, he continues, “[i] ts popularization in the\nterm ‘sustainable development’ created an invitation to use it for all sorts of objectives\npurported to be desirable (‘sustainable economy’, ‘sustainable growth’, ‘sustainable\npolicies’, etc.) ”. This conceptual “ transformation ”, predicated firmly on the idea of\neconomic growth, usually shows up, Sachs affirms on his part, a “[...] long-frustrated\nsouthern desire to change the balance of power of the world in [...]” development’s\nfavour.201\nIn practice, one could also visualise the propensity to highlight development (especially\neconomic one) from the concept of sustainability within the Sustainable Development Goals",

However, it\nis fair to say there are various goals intended to attain environmental challenges related to\nclimate change, conservation, protection, and restoration of Nature (including, oceans, seas,\nforests, biodiversity, and other ecosystems).202\nConversely, although it does not deal with a mandatory instrument but soft law, the\nAsian Human Rights Charter interestingly conceptualises sustainable development as a sort\nof limitation to economic growth. Therefore, one can read: “ Economic development must be\nsustainable. We must protect the environment against the avarice and depredations of\ncommercial enterprises to ensure that the quality of life does not decline just as the gross\nnational product increases ”.203 In context, nevertheless, the paragraph denotes a thoroughly\nimplicit invocation of the anthropocentric bias towards the warranty of living conditions,\ni.e., the protection of Nature in favour of the human benefit.\nSumming up, after semantic scrutiny of the international treaties’ texts, where one can\nfind references regarding sustainability, one might notice an overall tendency toward\nstressing the role of economic development over environmental protection, including a sort\nof emphasis upon the international market and financial resources.

The significance of his view concerning the idea of\nsustainable development has some ramifications. Firstly, he attributes the emergence of the\nconcept to ancestral wisdom, employing as examples the ancient regulations of the\nirrigation-systems coming from Sri Lankan, African, Iranian, Chinese, and Incan\ncivilisations and cultures. To him, the human need to reconcile development and\nenvironment did not come into being from modern sources of law exclusively. It responds\nto a transmission process of traditional wisdom, which inspired those ancient legal systems\ncapable of handling ecologic problems. In parenthesis, the theoretical positions regarding\nthe rights of Nature are coincident with this argument. Consequently, according to the\ninterpretation of Klaus Bosselmann, “[t] he idea of sustainability has its roots in the history\nof humankind ”. In contrast, other authors, such as Weiss and Scherzer, do not share this\nargument, even stating its origins trace barely to the 1970s.208\nSecondly, in accordance with the previous statement, Weeramantry emphasised that\nhuman need for living in harmony with Nature has been present virtually in every single\ncivilisation around the world. In his words, the Judge asserted that “[i] n relation to concern\nfor the environment generally, examples may be cited from nearly every traditional system,\nranging from Australasia and the Pacific Islands, through Amerindian and African cultures\nto those of ancient Europe ”. Moreover, he seems to believe in the interdependence between\nNature and people, arguing even the own subsistence of people relies on the harmonic\ninterplay them. In this regard, he states that “[...] harmony between humanity and its\nplanetary inheritance is a prerequisite for human survival ”.209\nIn this line of reasoning, Judge Weeramantry’s criteria have been decisive to\ncomplement the legal conceptualisation of sustainability in the global range. The former\nVice President of the International Court of Justice asserted that the notion of sustainable\ndevelopment goes beyond the present generations and the ambit of the law. It deals with a\nhistorical construction, whose origins trace to ancestral wisdom over time. It does not\ndefinitively respond to a contemporary emergence or a legal elaboration exclusively.

His reproach predicated on the fact that\nit could cause that humans discard those “ pristine and universal values ” that should govern\nthe interplay between people and Nature; i.e., love of Nature, desire for its preservation, and\nrespect its maintenance and continuance. In his words, “[...] the time has come when they\nmust once more be integrated into the corpus of the living law ”. To Bosselmann, one could\nexplain the alluded formalism through the “ positivism ” of law, which arose as a separation\nbetween moral values and legal contents since the eighteenth century. In response,\nWeeramantry suggests that contemporary legal systems concerning environment should\nincorporate the “ experience of the past ” following the so-called “[...] congruence of fit\nbetween traditional tribal methods [...] and the nature of the land, water and climate [...]”,\na terminology taken originally from Fernea211.\nTo recapitulate, despite the scholar endeavours to endow sustainability with an ecofriendly character in the light of international law, such as Judge Weeramantry’s opinion, it\nis apparent that sustainable development deals with a principle deep-rooted in the tradition\nof anthropocentrism. It is also hardly separated from the search of human welfare and\nsubsequent economic growth. Its central idea regarding the benefit of future generations is\nthe quintessential example, considering it involves an intergenerational responsibility\nbetween the present and next people, let alone the recurrent allusions to the uses of natural\nresources (either sustainable or equitable), and the integration of environmental and\neconomic aspects.212 All these components constitute a vision thoroughly human-centred,\nwhich gets deepened when one analyses the legal framework.",

Sands, for example, assures that the idea regarding\npresent generations “[...] hold the earth in trust for future generations is well known to\ninternational law ”,215 a statement quite parallel to the avoidance of compromising\nforthcoming needs.\nIn practice, the legal statements on future generations do not seem to imply any\noperational effects of importance upon Nature.

Thus, the concerning\ninstruments do not go beyond the frequent mention of the cliché regarding that the\nenhancement of ecological conditions is useful “ for the benefit of present and future\ngenerations ”.

    "text": "The present chapter principally enquired into two scholarly issues, derived from the\nefficiency of law and legal representation. Effectively, the first one consisted of determining\nthe sufficiency of existing legal mechanisms to protect the environment. Instead, the second\none involved the need and subsequent feasibility of recognising the legal representation of\nNature as a subject of international law. In this regard, this chapter comprises of two sections\nto ease the analysis of each topic separately.\nRegarding the first research question, i.e., if the existing legal mechanisms are enough\nto protect and respect Nature in itself, and not necessarily for human sake, one should\nargue there is abundant evidence otherwise, namely international treaties -either global or\nregional ones- continuously emphasise the importance of people’s welfare over Nature.\nThus, for example, it has been said the regulations of the right to a healthy environment\nattempt to enhance ecological conditions to favour adequate living standards (e.g., physical\nand mental health, food, clothing, housing, and so on). Therefore, no environmental\nimprovement is exclusively eco-friendly in itself, given that it aims at benefitting human\nwellbeing. Indeed, authors often assume this right is an extension of the inherent right to life,\nclosely associated with health and suitable standards of living.\nIn the conflict between fundamental rights and human rights (e.g., the right to life v.\nproperty rights, or environmental protection v. development) the restriction of rights\nconstitutes a legitimate solution. In this regard, for example, the limitation of property rights\ncould make up a manner to promote the protection of Nature as an inseparable component\nfrom the right to life. Notwithstanding, for meeting this goal, Nature must compose an\nindependent legal entity because the traditional application of the anthropocentric, individual\nhuman rights approach has failed to preserve the environment for decades, as a result of the\nexploitative, hegemonic operation of global capitalism. The reason lies in the fact that the\nanthropocentric principles, along with its procedural boundaries, have not been able to\nimprove the efficiency of environmental protection, even with the use of procedural [human]\nrights. Although the sustainability would offer a kind of compromise, self-restraint of States\nand markets do not work, so one must find an alternative solution to protect the ecosystems.\nIn principle, although ecological measures based on the right to a healthy environment\ndo enhance the ecosystemic conditions, they do not operate if there is no demonstrable\nwelfare for people, according to international law. Whether it is not for human sake, it does\nnot seem justifiable to take any measures to protect Nature. Consequently, current\ninternational environmental normative concerning the right to a healthy environment is not\nsufficient to warrantee the protection and respect of Nature. It possesses a mere instrumental\nfunction, where natural resources get represented as suppliers of goods and services.\nLikewise, the principles around sustainability tend toward guaranteeing anthropocentric\nconditions instead of green ones. The profuse references concerning the eradication of\npoverty, social development, the increased participation of women, youth, and Indigenous,\namong others, as constitutive elements of sustainable development illustrate very well its\npropensity for preferring human sake over Nature’s.\nIn a similar vein, several instruments show decisive support of international trade within\nthe framework of sustainability. They bring into question any restriction to its regular\noperation, even when the mentioned constraints concentrate attention on environmental\nobjectives (Convention on Climate Change is particularly illustrative thereof). Furthermore,\nthey also emphasise the “ sustained or sustainable economic growth ” as one of the priorities\nof development and as an essential mechanism to reach sustainability.\nAccordingly, the existence of various social and economic preferences over Nature\nsignifies that sustainability international laws’ promote a human-centred standpoint and,\nabove all, the achievement of sustainable development in practice does not necessarily imply\nthe enhancement of ecological conditions per se. Human welfare will be the clue aspect to\nconsider when one should apply politics, programmes, and projects intended to reach\nsustainable development.\nThere is a parallelism between future generations and the previously alluded cases. As\nmentioned, the notion of forthcoming people is conceptually anthropocentric, given it refers\nto human beings in principle. It is true those people do not exist at present, but they are going\nto be humans in the future. Consequently, the protection of Nature on behalf of persons-tocome does not represent an ecological end in itself, it rather constitutes an instrumental aim,\nuseful for the search of human wellbeing. Following this logic, it would not be justifiable\nthe application of environmental provisions if it does not entail any benefit for upcoming\npeople. Therefore, this schema of protection is neither enough to protect Nature.\nAs an overall conclusion, whether black-letter law does not offer enough warranties to\nprotect Nature, let alone its enforcement in practice. The application of eco-friendly policies,\nprogrammes, action plans, and so forth will not be significantly efficient to avoid ecological\ndevastation if their legal sources are neither enough to accomplish green aims. To some\nextent, the association with human welfare could mean an obstacle concerning conservation,\nprotection, or restoration of Nature, among other favourable actions. Notwithstanding, it\ndoes not mean international legislation is thoroughly useless to cope with the environmental\ncrisis, owing to many treaties [‘ specific provisions ’ to be exact] have turned out to be\nsuccessful. Unfortunately, this is not the case of the whole global or regional legislation.\nHence, one cannot conclude the existing legal mechanisms are sufficient to defend and\nrespect Nature in itself in the ambit of international law.\nThe second research question consisted of establishing how necessary the\nrepresentation of Nature as a bearer of rights and a subject of international law would be\nin the current state of legal affairs. The response to this query initially derives from the\nprevious one, namely if international environmental law cannot be satisfactorily employed\nto protect Nature, it becomes imperative to represent its interests in the juridical arena. As a\nresult of this assertion, someone could wrongly believe there is not any form to defend\nNature legally. It is not the case, however, given the fact that States have been traditionally\nin charge of protecting natural resources.\nEffectively, the first section of the present chapter contains many indications regarding\nthe existence of States as the most ancient and traditional subjects of international law. For\na long time, they have even constituted the only ones. In this regard, although historical\nregulations have recognised the legal personhood of other participants, actors, or\nstakeholders-such as NGOs, confederations, and even human beings, among others-States\nhave been customarily the institutions responsible for environmental protection.\nNevertheless, the relationship between State and Nature does not correspond to a couple\nof actors interacting on an equal footing. Their interplay resembles what occurs between\nowner and ownership, meaning the notion of property or any other associated form of\ncontrol, such as sovereignty, links both concepts together. The implications of property\nrights, however, will get examined in the next chapter. For the time being, one has to keep\nin mind that Nature has been historically a set of goods, or even commodities, intended to\nmeet human needs. As a result, States have managed Nature as things under their control\nand will continue to do it, instead of considering it as a group of beings endowed with\nspecific interests. Thus, the representation of Nature, based on the current international\nlegislation, merely reproduces the anthropocentric connotation of the right to a healthy\nenvironment, sustainable development, or future generations.\nLikewise, as mentioned before, the rights-based approach predominantly implies the\nincorporation of environmental issues into the international system of human rights. Not on\nthe contrary. It deals with a thoroughly anthropocentric standpoint. Therefore, no matter the\nemployed method-either the green reinterpretation of existing entitlements or the creation\nof new ones-international law will tend to prioritise people’s welfare over Nature’s. In other\nwords, instruments of human rights will emphasise detrimental impacts on people rather than\non the wild itself, because it is their original essence. Accordingly, one cannot pretend the\nprotection of Nature predominate in front of social interests within this ambit of the law.\nMoreover, as argued throughout this chapter, one cannot lose sight of the fact that States\nhave an obligation to protect both human beings and Nature. States are even responsible for\nthe respect of human rights, mainly through the justice system. In this regard, it turns out\nquite difficult to believe that States are knowingly going to enforce international treaties in\nfavour of Nature; even though their provisions generally cherish the inherent values of\nhuman beings more than purely environmental interests.\nAs mentioned, the last assertion definitively does not mean the international legal\nframework is thoroughly useless to protect Nature. It only implies that the enforcement of\ninternational law is going to support human beings instead of Nature in case of any conflict\nbetween their respective interests. In such circumstances, one could conclude States are not\nalways the best protectors of ecosystems. Therefore, by way of a response to the second\nresearch question, it is worth acknowledging the need to count on an independent and\nlegitimate actor [different from State], someone who can be legally capable of representing\nNature in front of harmful human activities. Who is it? It is coming next.",

    "text": "The present legal analysis posits the hypothesis concerning humanity subdues Nature\nthrough an ongoing process of objectification, commodification, and subsequent acquisition\nof ownership, under the shelter of the rule of law. In other words, the relationship between\nhuman beings and Nature unfolds principally in the function of property rights, where the\nformer is the owner of the latter.\nThe argument, however, does not represent a novel idea. Quite the contrary, David Boyd\nrecalls that, as early as 1765, Sir William Blackstone assured “[t] he earth, therefore, and all\nthings therein, are the general property of all mankind, exclusive of other beings, from the\nimmediate gift of the creator ”. According to Boyd himself, this condition persists until these\ndays, due to humans have virtually laid claim the property of almost every piece of land and\nspecies, especially animals, on earth. “ Everything in [N]ature, animate and inanimate,\nconstitutes our property ”, he alleges.216\nIn this line of reasoning, the methodological premise of this chapter supports the idea\nthat the international legal system establishes the prevalence of property rights above\nenvironmental protection, an assertion held by a bulk of anthropocentrism’s opponents217.\nNevertheless, it does not necessarily mean that global and regional juridical regulations\nsolely promote or bring about the current ecological devastation or have had to do with it in\nthe past. Indeed, some of the treaties mentioned earlier regarding threatened species,\nbiodiversity, desertification, among others, have shown favourable ecological results. In any\ncase, one cannot deny either the international discourse of the law, currently in force, tends\nunfailingly to benefit people to the detriment of Nature much of the times.\nAdditionally, one cannot forget the analysis of state-owned or public ownership, which\nbeyond its name, conception, or scope, eventually belongs to humans, as Boyd points out.\nFurthermore, one should take into account that the exercise of this public property predicates\nprincipally on the sovereign authority of States. Thus, the notion of sovereignty suggests the\nidea of property rights because, as Schrijver contends, it brings on a list of associated",

So, the first point at issue will consist of tracing back if Nature is or not\nconsidered as a set of things, subject to property rights, in the light of the international\nlegal framework. The response to this enquiry purports to take it for granted that\ninternational law deems Nature as an assemblage of things, given this aspect appeared in the\nlast chapter, being useless revisit the question once again. Moreover, it is worth mentioning\nthe commercialisation of natural resources will comprise a significant element of study to\nkeep in mind for this point.\nSecondly, the next research question pretends to supplement the previous one, given\nthat suggests the comparison between property rights and Nature as well, in terms of\nhierarchies. As announced in the introduction, the question deals with confirming the\nassumption that property rights are more important than Nature, within the international\nlegal framework. To some extent, the enquiry also aims at corroborating if ecocentrists and\nother anthropocentrism’s critics are right when they argue that environmental crisis is\nsomehow the consequence of a human-centred administration of natural resources, based on\na supposed superiority of property over Nature.\nOne additional methodological aspect is coming. In the realm of international\nenvironmental law, there are a couple of severe hindrances of study: quantity and scope of\ninformation. Effectively, the enormous number of existing conventions and other\nagreements makes an exhaustive analysis exceedingly difficult (one can find a little more\nthan one hundred documents). Likewise, in terms of range, the contents of instruments about\nenvironmental issues are quite heterogeneous. Thus, while some materials encompass\nconcerns of a global spectrum, such as climate change or public participation, others embrace\na much more concrete topic. Among the latter, there are regulations concerning specific\necosystems (air, water, soil) or even resources (ozone layer, biodiversity, watercourses).\nFurthermore, one could find precise rules dedicated to potentially harmful actions or events\n(movement of hazardous waste, industrial accidents, illegal trade), environmental impacts\n(desertification, pollution), and so forth. Much of the times, two or more issues even appear\noverlapped.",

As one could\ninfer, both definitions constitute indisputable insinuations to ownership, save the peculiar\nallusion to people, derived from the term “ staff”, as part of the concept of “ assets”. In the\nvery dictionary, one of the multiple significances of “ wealth” corresponds to “ plentiful\nsupplies of a particular resource: the country's mineral wealth ”. Moreover, another less\nintricate dictionary explanation -coming from Longman- relates to “ wealth” as “a large\namount of money, property, etc. that a person or country owns ’. Likewise, “ resource” is\n“something such as useful land or minerals such as oil or coal that exists in a country and\ncan be used to increase its wealth ”.222\nAs a complement, there are two additional identical provisions, one in each covenant,\nwhere it is possible to identify the same matching between both expressions. They provide\nthat: “Nothing in the present Covenant shall be interpreted as impairing the inherent right\nof all peoples to enjoy and utilize fully and freely their natural wealth and resources ”.223\nNevertheless, beyond this matching, the principal idea consists of it is perhaps the first time-\nchronologically seen-that one can notice a hierarchical relationship between humans and\nNature enshrined expressly in the international law. In other words, as one is going to review\nlater, it would be possible to affirm that nothing can obstruct the exercise of property rights\nover natural resources for human benefit.\nHowever, one of the most significant examples in this matter is undoubtedly the\nanthropocentric concept of “ biological resources”, whose scope encompasses both their\nbenefit for humanity and their economic value. Effectively, the Convention on Biological\nDiversity states that “ Biological resources includes genetic resources, organisms or parts\nthereof, populations, or any other biotic component of ecosystems with actual or potential\nuse or value for humanity ”. As one can notice, this definition even seems to suggest a sort\nof goods’ list to use for human sake. The whole document is, in fact, replete with references\nto the sustainable or customary use of biodiversity. Moreover, one of the very objectives\nconsists precisely of its sustainable use, including the sharing of benefits-a straightforward\neconomic connotation-which constitutes a reaffirmation about the human-centred outlook\nthat characterises the convention’s contents.224",

Indeed, the first statement of the preamble begins by this recognition:\n“Conscious of the intrinsic value of biological diversity and of the ecological, genetic,\nsocial, economic , scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values of\nbiological diversity and its components ”.225 As one can see, however, two of the most\nconflicting terms regarding the disjunction between biocentrism and anthropocentrism, i.e.,\n“intrinsic” and “economic ”, form interestingly part of this recital.\nThis proclamation, however, contradicts the overall sense of the convention, whose core\nobjective does not aim just at “ biodiversity conservation ”, as mentioned, but also\n“sustainable use ”. Consequently, it is not rare that economic value and the importance of\necosystems, habitats, communities, species, genomes, and genes be together part of the\ncritical factors to identify and monitor them, in order to accomplish their purposes of\nconservation and sustainable use. It deals with a practical illustration of how international\nlaw does not promote conservation of Nature in itself, but rather for human welfare (e.g.,\nscientific, medicinal, or agricultural usages), just as it happened with the traditional ethical\ndiscourse.226\nIn the same line of reasoning, the instrument comprises the recognition of investments\nfor biodiversity conservation and the expectation of gaining profits from them. Therefore,\nthe contracting parties should adopt, since possible, economic measures to incentive\nconservation and sustainable use of biological resources. The convention, in sum, places the\neconomic, social, and environmental benefits, at least, at the same level of significance.\nFurthermore, economic development makes up explicitly one of the first and overriding\npriorities of developing countries. The continuing slant toward profitable outputs seems to\nbe persistent.227\nLikewise, the employment of the term “ production ” and its derivative words-such as\nproductive or productivity-within the ambit of the Convention to Combat Desertification\nleads to thinking about Nature-especially land-as a good or a set of goods. In that regard, it\nturns out curious that the concept of “ land” comprises the idea of a “ terrestrial bioproductive system ”, instead of the association with natural habitat, environment,",

Of course, it is not a strict conclusion, given the definition\nof land effectively suggests the idea of an ecosystem in context, including some of its core\nelements, such as soil, vegetation, and ecological processes, among others.228\nIn consequence, one could argue that the role of the word “ production ” and the\nassociated terminologies refer to biological implications of land (there is a similar approach\nin the definition of drought). Nevertheless, the continuing connotations regarding the\neconomic repercussions of production and security of food, the guarantee of living\nconditions, and the improvement of financial situation end up granting a chrematistic -even\nwith a sense of marketability- character to the whole document. It would be enough to check\nthe definition of “ land degradation ”, in which the mention of economic productivity is\nexplicit, to confirm the commercial feature of the convention and the anthropocentric\npenchant to deem land as a permanent supply of goods for human sake.229\nOne can find another illustration of the commercial sense of international law in the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It reads: “ Within the framework of the\nprovisions set out in this Chapter, all restrictions on the movement of capital between\nMember States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited ”. This\nprohibition includes any limitation to acquire or transfer lands to any other European citizen\nor company, being land one of the capital goods. In other words, the buy-and-sell of lands\nand real state constitutes fundamental freedom and is part of the free movement of capital in\nEurope.230\nAccordingly, when one thinks about the connotation of Nature, taken from the context\nof international instruments, it would turn out pretty tricky not to think about natural wealth\nor resources as a string of goods or commodities, available for people’s benefit.",

These constraints\nground mainly on public, general, or social interests (also utility), and a variety of specific\nlegal conditions (e.g., taxes, contributions, penalties, money-lending, and so on).\nFurthermore, the instruments lay down economic compensations in those cases in which the\nproperty rights must be constrained, according to law.\nIn parenthesis, the Asian Human Rights Charter poses a different approach.

In this sense, the instruments state: “ Nothing in the present\nCovenant shall be interpreted as impairing the inherent right of all peoples to enjoy and\nutilize fully and freely their natural wealth and resources ”.234\nSo, the notion of “ possession ”, understood as “[t] he fact of having or holding property\nin one's power [or] the exercise of dominion over property ”,235 lies semantically in the\npossessive determiner “ their”, which assigns the belonging of the “ natural wealth and\nresources ” to the noun “ all peoples”, namely “ their natural wealth and resources ”.\nMoreover, when one reads that “ nothing” in the covenants shall be interpreted as impairing\nthat inherent right (enjoy and utilise), it gives somehow the impression about the existence\nof a precise control excluding others, in the same legal sense that possession requires.\nThe discursive effect derived from the fact that no circumstance can obstruct the\nexercise of these inherent rights illustrates quite well the hierarchical influence of property\nrights upon Nature in the field of international law. Furthermore, one can find an allusion to\nthe state possession of genetic resources within the concept of “ country of origin ”, alluded\nto in the Convention on Biological Diversity, as a straightforward reference to the notion of\nstate property. All of it suggests a kind of prevalence of the extractive perspective over the\nconservationist one, which concurs with the predominance of property rights upon the\nenvironmental concerns.236\nTo further make sense, both covenants reads: “ In no case may a people be deprived of\nits own means of subsistence ”. Initially, being a possessive adjective, the word “ own”\nlinguistically reinforces the sense of belonging, which reaffirms the concept of “ possession ”.\nIn the end, this means property rights. Nonetheless, the affair goes beyond. By placing both\nexpressions at the same level, this provision in some way leads to thinking about “ means of\nsubsistence ” as “natural wealth and resources ”, i.e., as parallel ideas. This interpretation\naligns with the working hypothesis regarding Nature is deemed a set of goods, according to\ninternational law.",

In that regard, it is worth quoting the preamble of the Convention on Biological\nDiversity, which reads that “[...] conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity is\nof critical importance for meeting the food, health and other needs of the growing world\npopulation ”. Moreover, the recurrent allusion to the sustainable use of biodiversity and\ngenetic resources (including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits, whose connotation is\nundoubtedly economic) makes up a singular example of the instrumental approach of Nature,\nwithin the field of international law. Its significance comes to the point of being one of the\nfundamental objectives established in the corresponding convention, even at the same level\nas conservation .240\nNotwithstanding, the persistent association between conservation and use along the\nConvention on Biological Diversity leads the belief that the protection of Nature (e.g.,\nbiodiversity and genetic resources) is not an ecological challenge in itself, but rather a\nmechanism to guarantee the satisfaction of human needs (e.g., food or health). To some\nextent, this idea is somehow contradictory, because it suggests that conservation is crucial\nas long as it allows extending through time the logic of exploitation of Nature, on behalf of\nindividuals.\nLikewise, following virtually the same logic as the Convention on Biodiversity, the\nultimate objective of the Convention on Climate Change contains a specific warranty to\nprotect nourishment, which comprises an explicit reference about the utilisation of Nature\nfor people’s benefit. Indeed, the instrument’s core aim involves achieving stabilisation of\ngreenhouse gas concentrations, inter alia, to ensure that food production is not threatened. In\nother words, it deals with safeguarding the raw material (natural resources) to avoid any risk\nconcerning a potential lack of foodstuff.\nIn parallel, one can also perceive within the Convention on Climate Change a propensity\nto encourage a lessened human intervention to facilitate the natural resilience of ecosystems,\ncombined altogether with a kind of promotion of economic development (growth?), and [of\ncourse] with the assurance of food production.

So, for\ninstance, there is a specific recognition of fossil fuels as goods to produce, use, process, and\nexport within the framework of international trade, particularly from the perspective of\ndeveloping countries. Similarly, the potential repercussions of the “ adverse effects of climate\nchange” in the welfare of humankind concerning the productivity of natural ecosystems\nencompass the idea of an anthropocentric and instrumental utilisation of Nature within the\nagreement’s provisions.242\nWithin this framework, the Convention to Combat Desertification is perhaps the\nexample par excellence, given it counts on several references to conservation and sustainable\nmanagement and use of natural resources (especially land and water). The very objective of\nbattling against desertification and drought aims at the improvement of land productivity\nand living conditions, among other human needs, instead of being inclusive also with the\necological worries. Likewise, the establishment and strengthening of food security are often\nsuggestions for national action programmes, capacity-building, education, and public\nawareness.243\nDespite the quoted references, the point concerning the “ use” of Nature does not come\nbarely from the 1990s.

When the transference refers to property rights, it is called\n“alienation ”. Consequently, according to Gifis, alienation deals with “[...] voluntary\ntransfer of title and possession of real property to another person ”. Moreover, the author\nstates that: “ The law recognizes the power to alienate (or transfer) property as an essential\ningredient of fee simple ownership of property and generally prohibits unreasonable\nrestraints on alienation ”.247\nIn a certain sense, alienation or disposition represents the essence of property in the\nframework of the relationship between human beings and Nature. Transfer does not only\nmake up the mechanism by which the former owner relinquishes his/her entitlement in\nfavour of the new one or new ones, but it also implies the existence of a bundle of goods\n(usually natural ones), which ultimately belong to people. In other words, the transfer of the\nproperty upon “ natural things ” from old owners to new ones depicts a clear picture of\nanthropocentrism in legal practice, i.e., the hierarchical interplay between subjects and\nobjects of law.\nWithin the specific realm of international law, the concept of alienation/disposition is\nentirely visible in the ambit of the 1966-covenants, which contain unambiguous allusions\nabout the inherent right to “ freely dispose of ” natural wealth and resources.248",

In this framework, the CITES represents the epitome.\nFrom the own title, the CITES contains probably one of the most human-centred discourses\nof the whole international arena. The recognition of a system of trade around biodiversity\ndoes not only mean considering flora and fauna as interchangeable commodities but mainly\nacknowledging the possibility of fixing prices and paying costs, essential characteristics of\nproperty rights, without setting aside the existence of owners. Indeed, the majority of the\ntwenty-five articles comprising the convention possess regulations regarding the trade of\nspecies, the commercial purposes, or, at least, evocative references in practice. Similarly,\nthis terminology fills up the appendices.\nThe wide range of normative standards encompasses theoretical and abstract definitions,\nas well as concrete and empirical applications regarding Nature, understood as a set of goods.\nThe legal conception of “ trade”, for example, could embrace virtually all possibilities of\nbusiness with species of fauna and flora in the international legal framework. The CITES\nreads: “Trade means export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea ”. Likewise, the\nconvention makes the existence of property rights upon Nature clear, when it states there are\n“[...] specimens that are personal or household effects ”, in practice. Moreover, it raises\nexplicitly the possibility that the owners can acquire, import, and export their specimens.249\nScrutinising the provisions, one can even notice a thoroughly utilitarian/instrumental\napproach, such as the option to breed and propagate species of animals and plants for\n“commercial purposes ”. Not only this but, by way of a further example, one of the\nconvention’s appendix also includes the establishment of “[a] nnual export quotas for trade\nin bones, bone pieces, bone products, claws, skeletons, skulls and teeth [of lions] for\ncommercial purposes, derived from captive breeding operations in South Africa ”.250\nCuriously, the circumstance of trading species in parts suggests that it is not so\nsignificant if animals and plants are alive or dead to be deemed specimens in the light of\ninternational law. Being alive is not a requisite to be subjects of commerce.251 In the end,",

Animals\nand plants would be notably commodities to be purchased or sold.\nSumming up, although the CITES’ core principles are literally oriented to establish a\nseries of strict regulations protecting, preventing, and constraining the exploitation of\nendangered species, they wind up facilitating the commerce in the function of different\ndegrees of restrictions, going from the more severe to the laxer ones.\nOn its part, although the Convention on Climate Change does not engage the question\nof commerce directly with the effects of global warming, it does emphatically restrict the\nscope of environmental measures if they somehow obstruct the international market. This\nforthright anthropocentric provision reads: “ Measures taken to combat climate change,\nincluding unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable\ndiscrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade ”. At least in a discursive\nmanner, it means guaranteeing a predominant relationship between commerce and\nenvironment, wherein the former depicts a more significant role than the latter within the\ninternational arena.252\nMoreover, the instrument establishes “ a certain degree of flexibility ” regarding the\nimplementation of national green commitments in favour of those countries that undergo the\nprocess of “ transition to a market economy ”. It denotes once again a kind of favouritism\ntowards a commercial outlook. The Convention on Biological Diversity contains a similar\nreference concerning the voluntary assumption of obligations by those countries involved in\nthis process of transition to a market economy.253\nAnother reference regarding commerce consists of intellectual property rights. Within\nthis field, one can even read between the lines a sharp propensity to grant more value to\nproperty rights than to Nature. Accordingly, for instance, adverse effects upon intellectual\nproperty rights constitute one of the legitimate causes to deny access to environmental\ninformation. Indeed, the Aarhus Convention lays down “[t] he confidentiality of commercial\nand industrial information, where such confidentiality is protected by law in order to protect\na legitimate economic interest ”.254 One should wonder, however, what the meaning of\n“legitimate economic interest ” is.

In any case, once again this provision constitutes another example in which\neconomic interests prevail over Nature’s.\nSimilarly, perhaps due to desertification and drought constitute environmental effects,\nclosely associated with the human needs of soils’ production and subsequently of\nnourishment, the Convention to Combat Desertification could be a perfect example. In fact,\nit contains a couple of sturdy references about the protection of intellectual property rights,\nespecially in the realm of technology.\nMoreover, there is certain logic of the market when the instrument stipulates that the\nowners of the knowledge, know-how, and other practices should directly be beneficiaries\nfrom any commercial utilisation of them or any technological development derived from\nthem.255 By mentioning the idea of commercial use, one immediately can image the\npossibility of buying and selling knowledge, which means favouring the operationalisation\nof trading intangibles (rights) through alienation.\nBeyond its anthropocentric tendency, however, the fact that this commercial utilisation\nwould also encompass ancestral wisdom, under the umbrella of local and traditional\nknowledge, could become dangerous for people and Nature. The potential negotiation of\nthese kinds of experiences, know-how, and practices could imply the utter ravage of\ncommunity property rights in favour of private owners. In principle, this circumstance\nshould not be unfair, given the transference of property is perfectly legal in most countries.\nSo, why would this be a problem? The answer involves the fact that traditional knowledge\nis regularly a common, or a shared-ownership good. Therefore, its collective character\npermits free access to the community members, free access that could be restricted if its legal\nstatus becomes private.\nOne might think, for instance, about traditional or folk medicine. There are a lot of\ntherapeutic uses of plants and animals, whose practice has been transmitted from generation\nto generation for centuries, principally within indigenous peoples. What would happen if\nthose peoples would suddenly lose control over their natural resources? Usually, they do not\neven come up to sanitarian services owing to that their treatments of illness are deeply rooted\nin lengthy traditions. Consequently, an undesirable lack of access to traditional knowledge\nwould place their very existence in jeopardy. Something similar occurs when speaking about\nagriculture.",

All these elements configure the issue of poverty, which\nwould not be significant if it were not because a good number of scholars associate the\nimpoverished conditions with environmental exhaustion.\nEffectively, as mentioned in the introduction, some neoclassical economists often bond\nunsustainable management of Nature, and even environmental degradation, with lack or\nfailures in property rights.

In plain language, this incapability to possess and use\nlivelihoods tends to become in poverty.

    "text": "The connection between poverty and environmental deterioration as well as the response\nto trouble also appear-perhaps not so explicit-in the Rio Declaration. The alleviation of\npoverty comprises, in fact, an “ indispensable requirement ” for economic growth and\nsustainable development. According to the Rio Declaration, “ States should co-operate to\npromote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to economic\ngrowth and sustainable development in all countries, to better address the problems of\nenvironmental degradation ”. To Cullet, the instrument allows inferring that economic\ngrowth takes precedence over environmental protection, human rights and even\ndevelopment.265\nAlthough both the Stockholm Declaration and the Rio Declaration are not binding\ninstruments in the international sphere, their principles adequately express the trends of the\nglobal legislation and the legal parlance.\nIn this scheme of things, if poverty represents an obstacle for guaranteeing adequate\nenvironmental conditions, it is understandable that international law promotes its\npreferential elimination. In this regard, the Convention on Climate Change declares\nexplicitly that poverty eradication is one of “[...] the first and overriding priorities of the\ndeveloping country Parties ”, which has to be kept in mind such so into any response against\nclimate change. Likewise, identical provisions form part of the Convention on Biological\nDiversity.266\nOn its part, the Convention to Combat Desertification constitutes virtually the\nquintessence of the correlative connexion between poverty and ecological depletion,\ncounting on numerous references everywhere. For instance, one can read explicit statements,\nsuch as the following recital: “ Mindful that desertification and drought affect sustainable\ndevelopment through their interrelationships with important social problems such as poverty\n[...]”. Likewise, state parties should underpin research activities that “[...] take into account,\nwhere relevant, the relationship between poverty, migration caused by environmental",

Nevertheless, the most precise allusion is perhaps one of the\nobligations of affected country parties, namely “[...] address the underlying causes of\ndesertification and pay special attention to the socio-economic factors contributing to\ndesertification processes ”. Summing up, its overall approach denotes the idea that financial\nimpoverishment comprises implicitly one of the kernel sources of desertification and\ndrought, particularly in Africa.267\nThe Convention alludes to the eradication of poverty continuously to solve the problem.\nOnce again, notwithstanding, the mechanism employed to attain that aim consists\nparadoxically of economic growth [the document refers more strictly to “ sustainable\neconomic growth ”]. Effectively, the Annex I includes a special section regarding the\nmeasures to improve the economic environment and mitigate poverty. Among them, one\ncould mention the improvement of incomes and employment opportunities (through markets\nfor farm and livestock, financial instruments, diversification in agriculture, and so on),\nenhancement of long-term prospects of rural economies (through incentives for production,\ntax, and price policies, and promotion of growth), reduction of the population pressure on\nlands, and promotion of the use of resistant crops, among others.268\nTherefore, it deals with a clear-cut anthropocentric response, which is on a\nstraightforward collision course with the non-anthropocentric standpoints, above all, when\nthe latter ones affirm that the origin of ecological crisis is precisely the human-centred\nperspective. One could even speak about a circular reference, i.e., the economic growth as\nthe source of environmental crisis and the same economic growth to outpace it. In either\nevent, both environmental depletion and economic growth are “ priorities” throughout the\ninstrument.269\nThe question of soils’ production also complements the argument concerning the\ntriangle among economic growth, reduction of poverty and improvement of environmental\nconditions. By way of explanation, economic growth promotes the alleviation of poverty\nthroughout the enhancement of land production. There are explicit allusions in this sense.\nThus, for one, the convention lays down the amelioration of soil productivity is one of the\nstrategies to achieve the objective to combat desertification and mitigate drought.\nNonetheless, it is also possible to find out a thoroughly opposite interpretation about the role\nof production, i.e., as a cause of the problem. In Annex II, for instance, one reads “[...] the",

The former promotes desertification, while the latter helps to resolve\nthe problem. Nevertheless, the agriculture of the poor is usually a sort of production just for\nsubsistence. It does not have typically to do with extensive farming. In sum, it turns out a\nkind of contradictory arguing the cause of a problem could be its solution.\nMoreover, a scrutiny of the text makes one think about the key difference lies in the\n“improvement of production ”. Indeed, the contextual sense of the convention denotes that\ninadequate production of land promotes its environmental degradation and poverty, among\nother impacts. That is why, perhaps, the enhancement of soil productivity constitutes a\nmechanism to combat desertification, as mentioned above. Nevertheless, one enquires\noneself, what means the improvement of production? Within the framework of the\ndocument, one could define it-for instance-in terms of enhancement of technology,\nknowledge, know-how, and other practices. There is a good number of references within the\ntext to support this argument.271\nIn the end, however, a comprehensive reading of the convention allows understanding\nthat no matter the measure state-parties should take to improve the production of soils, all of\nthem subtly intend to increase the quantity of output. The very concept of “ combating\ndesertification ” proves that prevention, reduction, rehabilitation, and reclamation of lands\nare not the only ways of protecting soils from desertification. They also consist of forms to\nincrease the capacity of yield. Furthermore, one could argue the rise of productivity solely\nhas biological purposes. Nevertheless, several mentions concerning the security and\nproduction of food, just like the warranty of living conditions or the enhancement of the\neconomic environment, confirm the anthropocentric penchant to deem land as a permanent\nsupply of goods for human benefit and promote economic growth.272\nTo conclude, although alleviation of poverty might have a variety of ramifications\nconcerning human rights, it is not a common theme within the ambit of the regional\ninstruments.

    "text": "Within the traditional doctrine of international law, sovereignty is a paramount element to\nthe point of having been one of the conditions for the existence of the State (others have been\npeople, territory, and government). Oppenheim used to define it as the supreme authority,\n“[...] an authority which is independent of any other earthly authority ”, i.e., implying-in his\nwords-“independence all around, within and without the borders of the country ”.276\nNowadays, one cannot assure this way to understand the concept had changed so much.\nIn its strictest sense, some internationalists-like Peters-affirm that States do not only have\nto satisfy the effectiveness of legal personhood to be considered as such (that is people,\nterritory, and governance). Furthermore, they must demonstrate its government’s legitimacy,\nan aspect closely related to the recognition, even to the point of legality. In her opinion, the\ncontemporary debate focuses on the erosion of the concept as a consequence of globalisation.\nThen, one understands why recognition from others is so significant. In this regard, Peters\nwarns that “[a] lthough recognition by other states has only a declaratory effect, and\ntherefore de jure does not constitute or make a state , it has important practical effects ”.277\nTherefore, the concept of sovereignty has transmuted from the strict idea of power\ntoward “[t] he right of a state to self-government ”. However, its scope usually gets still\nassociated with “ the supreme [political] authority exercised by each state ”. In everyday\nlanguage, it is not rare to think about a connotation of the supremacy of State over the body\nof people which belongs to it, i.e., within the framework of a hierarchical relationship\n(internal). Likewise, it refers to the “[...] power of dealing on a nation's behalf with other\nnational governments ”, i.e., on an equal footing (external).278\nIn the realm of international environmental law, the idea of state power persists. Thus,\nfor example, the doctrine of state sovereignty holds “[...] that, within its territory, each",

This assertion does not only bring to the fore the\nfact that States exercise their authority over people and human activities inside their\nterritories, but a property rights-like relationship with their natural resources lies at the\nbottom as well. It turns out inevitable to notice a discursive closeness with Lynn White’s\nbiblical interpretation concerning humans subduing the earth with dominion over everything\n[anthropocentrism?].279\nIn any case, when one examines the scholar notion of sovereignty, as Timothy Endicott\nso appropriately points out, at least three aspects protrude regarding its value within the\nambit of international law: a) statehood , in front of other actors of the world scenery; b) selfdetermination , to make its own decisions, and c) independence , to avoid potential\ninterventions coming from third parties. All these elements have repercussions for the status\nof States at different ranges, principally concerning its recognition as legal persons, its\nexistence, and its raison d’être.280 In other words, a series of characteristics closely related\nto the legitimacy of the States.\nDue to the importance of statehood, self-determination and independence, their legal\nimplications will get perused in the following sections. Nevertheless, one should warn there\nis a singular aspect concerning the parallelism between these mentioned features of\nsovereignty and property rights. At a given moment, themes will even look the same because\nthe legal repercussions are also quite similar. In either event, the academic discourse\nencompasses the resemblances painstakingly, attempting to avoid redundancy and tautology\nto the extent feasible.\nMoreover, before passing that analysis, it would be useful to describe the origin and\ncontext of the power exercised by countries over their natural resources, through the notion\nof “permanent sovereignty ”.",

Firstly, one of the key reasons why the exercise of state sovereignty often shows\nup in the form of property rights is perhaps due to it precisely arose to protect own natural\nresources against property’s claims coming from alien third parties. Secondly, as one will\nnotice ahead, the developing countries’ interest in the definition and exercise of permanent\nsovereignty over their natural resources constitutes a continuous and recurrent remark in\nseveral international instruments associated with this theme until these days.\nOn the other hand, in addition to economic development, some authors282 often include\nand describe other sources concerning the emergence of state sovereignty over natural\nresources, as a principle of international law. They especially allude to self-determination,\nalthough interstate cooperation and even the tenet pacta sunt servanda ,283 among others, are\npart of the academic reflections. All of them play a specific role within the relationship\nbetween States and Nature, which will be the subject of analysis throughout this section.\nFocusing on particular regulations, one can trace the initial roots of state sovereignty in\na 1952-resolution, issued by the U.N.

As one can notice, exerting sovereignty represents an atypical form\nof property rights, say state ownership, given that the resolution confers the States the\nentitlements to use and exploit natural resources. Unlike the right to use, which is similar in\nboth cases, the right to exploit could be another way to define the right to dispose of, in\ncontext, namely the two components are eventually the same. In practice, therefore, it means\nStates are virtually the owners of natural resources.\nSome years later, as part of the “ Recommendations concerning international respect for\nthe right of peoples and nations to self -determination ” of 1958, the U.N. General Assembly\ndecided to appoint a commission to conduct a full survey of the status of the permanent\nsovereignty of peoples and nations over their natural wealth and resources, as to a\ncomplement of the two draft covenants elaborated by the Commission on Human Rights (the\nfuture economic and political covenants of 1966). For obvious reasons, the resolution also\ncomprised of a full survey of the right to self-determination.288\nSubsequently, the “ 1960-Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial\ncountries and peoples ” proclaimed a predictive recital, whose content appeared in the two\n1966-covenants, with verbatim text. That paragraph came to ratify and strengthen the\ninteraction between sovereignty and the use of natural resources, and other elements already\nalluded to, such as economic cooperation and mutual confidence (expression replaced by\n“mutual benefit ”). It read: “ Affirming that peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of\ntheir natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of\ninternational economic co-operation , based upon the principle of mutual benefit , and\ninternational law ”.289 In addition, as one can warn, this instrument employs the expression\n“dispose of ” instead of “ exploit”, somehow insinuating a particular affinity with property\nrights.\nJust with one day of difference, in 1960, a new resolution about the “ Concerted action\nfor economic development of economically less developed countries ”, came out.

Maybe\nbecause of its central theme was the acceleration of economic growth in developing\ncountries, its overall contribution to the question of sovereignty looks somehow irrelevant.\nEffectively, the resolution oriented to the diversification of productive activities, provision\nof capitals, technical training, investment assistance, commodity trade, industrialisation, and\nso forth.290\nIn 1962, the U.N. General Assembly issued probably the most important resolution\nconcerning the “ Permanent sovereignty over natural resources ”, whose orientation is\nthoroughly biased the national development and human welfare of the country related. It\ndeals with an anthropocentric instrument; however, whose contents are understandable\nowing to the time when it came out.291\nIn Shaw’s opinion, it constituted a kind of support for the “ economic self-determination ”\nof States, coming from the United Nations. Moreover, in context with the already mentioned\nDeclaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, the author\nargues it represents a significant development of the twentieth century in matters of\neconomic regulations. To Shaw, “[...] the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade, the United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development, and the establishment\nof the International Monetary Fund and World Bank ” is evidence.292\nIn essence, this resolution suggests every nation possesses complete freedom to\nestablish its own rules for the exploration, development, and disposition293 of its natural\nresources. They could include even specific legal actions to restrict private property, if\nnecessary, such as the nationalisation, expropriation294, or requisitioning, predicated on\nreasons of public utility, security, or national interests. Nevertheless, private interests should\nget protected through the payment of appropriate compensations, according to local and\ninternational laws. Furthermore, the instrument seems to denote that natural resources could\nrepresent one of the valid financial sources for state objectives, recommending even that",

In the same sense, see Hobe (2015) 7.\n293 Notice the curious reminiscence of property rights through the use of the word “ disposition ” within the\nambit of sovereignty.\n294 One should understand expropriation as the “[...] inherent power of a governmental entity to take privately\nowned property, esp. land, and convert it to public use, subject to reasonable compensation for the taking ”.\nThe concept is also known as “ eminent domain ” or “compulsory purchase ”. See Garner (2004) 1585.\nnational laws govern the entrance of foreign capitals and earned profits.295 As one can notice,\nthe exercise of state sovereignty holds growing parallelism with property rights.\nIn 1966, the U.N. General Assembly delivered a new resolution principally aimed at\nreaffirming the [this time so-called] “ inalienable ” right of all countries to exercise permanent\nsovereignty over their natural resources in the interest of their development. It had the same\nidentification name than 1962’s, i.e., “ Permanent sovereignty over natural resources ”. By\nand large, the instrument seems more explicit than the previous ones concerning the\nutilisation of natural resources for developmental ends, especially by developing countries.\nIt brings out the third recital, which undoubtedly confirms this approach. It reads:\n“Recognizing that the natural resources of the developing countries constitute a basis of\ntheir economic development in general and of their industrial progress in particular ”.\nFurthermore, the resolution, for instance, refers to aspects already addressed in the past, such\nas foreign investors, capitals, profits, among other questions derived from the exploitation\nof natural resources. However, it also regards new themes, such as the marketing of the\nenvironment or the know-how.296\nIn 1973, a new resolution arose to “[s] trongly reaffirms the inalienable rights of States\nto permanent sovereignty over all their natural resources, on land within their international\nboundaries as well as those in the sea-bed and the subsoil thereof within their national\njurisdiction and in the superjacent waters ”.297 This instrument, also named “ Permanent\nsovereignty over natural resources ”, generally did not contribute with anything novel to the\ntopic, although it has been part of passionate debate, briefly explained in the following\nparagraphs.\nOne year later, in 1974, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States enshrined\nthe right to permanent sovereignty over natural resources under a set of terminologies, which\nliaised it explicitly with the components of property rights. It reads: “ Every State has and\nshall freely exercise full permanent sovereignty, including possession, use and disposal ,\nover all its wealth, natural resources and economic activities ”.298 The writing is\nundoubtedly a determinant. In international parlance, once again, countries are owners of\nNature.",

Resolution No. 3171 (XXVIII) (1973) para. 1st.\n298 Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States (1974) Article 2 (1).\nAs a kind of confirming the last affirmation, the charter establishes that States must\ncooperate to exploit shared natural resources, through previous consultations and\ninformation, avoiding any damage to the “ legitimate interest of others ”. Likewise, countries\nare economically accountable for any depletion, exploitation, or damages generated to\nnatural resources in other foreign nations, peoples, or territories. Moreover, all States have\nto extend assistance to them.299 In a certain sense, as in property rights, if one possesses\nsomething with others, one should request permission for carrying out any activity.\nHowever, if one harms alien natural resources or territories, one has to redress the situation,\nespecially in monetary terms.\nTo conclude, there is a thought-provoking debate regarding the scope of the\ncompensation for expropriation or nationalisation of natural resources. The charter and the\nalready mentioned resolution No. 1803 (XVII) contain contradictory rules, which come\nfrom-in a certain way-the parallelism between sovereignty and property rights or, at least,\nfrom the manner how States should impose restrictions on ownership. Lung-Chu Chen\nexplains the controversy refers to the authoritative effect of both instruments and the\nestablishment of a new international economic order.300\nIn either event, while the charter establishes that every country should determine the\ncompensation “[...] taking into account its relevant laws and regulations and all\ncircumstances that the State considers pertinent ”, the resolution lays out that redress has to\nconsider “[...] the rules in force in the State taking such measures in the exercise of its\nsovereignty and in accordance with international law ”. As a complement, resolution No.\n3171 also contains a provision concerning this question, which leans more toward the sense\nof the charter, i.e., it provides that national legislation of each nation should settle the\ncompensation’s amount and the mode of payment.301 In short, given the three resolutions\ncome from the same origin, that is, the U.N. General Assembly, their prevalence would be\nwhat is in question. In other words, one should wonder what the applicable regulation is,\nconsidering they are openly opposite.\nAlthough there is not yet a generally accepted agreement about what normative prevails,\none can find at least a hint to address the issue in a 1977-arbitration concerned Libya’s\ndecision to nationalise two American oil companies.

In consequence, he ordered Libya to accomplish the\ncontracts and give them full effect.302\nAs to the issue of compensation, arbitrator Dupuy interestingly focused his analysis on\n“[...] the legal validity of the above-mentioned Resolutions and the possible existence of a\ncustom resulting therefrom ” (sic). To him, their legal value varied and relied primarily on\nthe type of resolution and the conditions linked to its adoption. In that regard, the arbitrator\nopted to employ for the evaluation of validity what he called the “[...] criteria usually taken\ninto consideration, i.e., the examination of voting conditions and the analysis of the\nprovisions concerned ”. As a result, after comparing the voting conditions of all resolutions\nwithin the ambit of the U.N. General Assembly, Dupuy concluded “[...] that only Resolution\n1803 (XVII) of 14 December 1962 was supported by a majority of Member States\nrepresenting all of the various groups ”. Oddly enough, the arbitrator discarded the other\nresolutions assuring that, although they “[...] were supported by a majority of States [...]”,\nnone “[...] of the developed countries with market economies which carry on the largest\npart of international trade ” did it instead.303 In practice, as one can notice, this argument\nillustrates how strong the bias toward economic issues and international trade used to be, not\nonly in the realm of law but also regarding its enforcement. For informative ends only,\nAnnexe # 3.7 shows the results of the voting alluded to by Dupuy.\nAdditionally, as a mechanism to support the presence of a customary rule, Dupuy\ndeemed it fit to distinguish between those regulations stating the existence of a right with\nagreement’s expressions coming from the generality of States, and those introducing new\nprinciples rejected by some representative groups of nations. In this framework, the\narbitrator deemed that resolution No. 1803 (XVII) did not create custom but confirmed one\nby formulating it and specifying its scope. In consequence, he concluded the alluded “[...]\nResolution 1803 (XVII) seems to this Tribunal to reflect the state of customary law existing\nin this field ”.304\nSumming up, as one can infer, during the earlier stages of the relationship between\nsovereignty and Nature, in the realm of international law, the tendency of the legal parlance",

It means that, without statehood, a country\ndoes not possess legal personality in practice and, consequently, it does not exist in the ambit\nof global legal relationships.\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, the criteria to determine statehood comes\nprimarily from the Montevideo Convention, in the function of four conditions: 1) a\npermanent population, 2) a defined territory, 3) a government, and 4) capacity to enter into\nrelations with the other States,305 a guideline usually taken for granted by several\ninternationalists306, despite the fact that it is only referential (it corresponds exclusively to\nAmerican nations) and there is not a generalised consensus about its applicability.\nIn that regard, although some authors307 see the proposal by Schwarzenberger and\nBrown as an alternative view, the difference regarding the components of statehood seems\nto be only superficial, i.e., it varies merely on the form, given that population, territory, and\ngovernment are part of the criteria.

    "text": "Lung-Chu Chen recollects the existence of that controversy concerning the recognition\nof States, depicted by the debate between two positions, the declaratory and constitutive\ntheoretical schools, respectively. The gist of the difference lies in the formalism of the\nacknowledgement. For the declaratory theorists, a proclamation is useless for all intents and\npurposes, given that the objective existence of the State predicates on the announced\nconditions of statehood (population, territory, government, and capacity of interrelationship\nwith others). For the constitutive ones instead, those conditions are not enough, so that a\nformal recognition must come from other members of the international community if the\nconcerned State wants to form part of it.309\nThe heated discussion is not new, existing even before the 1933-Montevideo\nConvention, and has counted on the participation of respected personages of international\nlaw, such as Oppenheim or Crawford, on opposite sides. In this regard, as early as 1905,\nOppenheim asserted that “[t] here is no doubt that statehood itself is independent of\nrecognition ”, but it is not enough. He promoted the constitutive theory, affirming that a “[...]\nState is and becomes an International Person through recognition only and exclusively ”.310\nAs one can infer, the recognition acquire validity when it comes from pairs.\nOn his part, James Crawford, celebrated Australian judge and scholar, has suggested the\nindicated conditions are sufficient to obtain international acknowledgement. For him, neither\ntheory of recognition explains the practice of modern States satisfactorily in this area. The\nwriter believes “[...] statehood is not ‘simply’ a factual situation but a legally defined claim\nof right, specifically to the competence to govern a certain territory ”. The author assumes\nthe alluded conditions are workable criteria for statehood.311\nAlthough Crawford wrote from the perspective of declaratory theory, he also showed\nup a critical argument against its postulates.

In a similar sense, for instance, see Strang (1996) 22; Klabbers (2010) 32-33.\n311 Crawford (1976) 95, 119. In the same line of thought, for example, see Murphy (2010) 300; Amerasinghe\nnations. A mere declaration of statehood is not enough too. For him, statehood is a “ claim of\nright”, and claims to statehood “[...] are not to be inferred from statements or actions short\nof explicit declaration ”. Hence, recognition should be express, and “[...] in practice\ndiscretionary, as well as determinative and the constitutive position will have returned, as it\nwere, by the back door ”.312\nTo get an idea regarding the intensity of the debate, it would turn out useful to quote the\nwords of Ti-Chiang Chen, who adduced that the operation of the law was what defined the\nlegal personality of States, not the mere recognition. “ By assuming that a State, once having\nsatisfied certain objective tests, ipso facto becomes a person in international law, [the author\nargued] the declaratory theory is spared the logical absurdities which embarrass constitutive\nwriters”.313\nIn either event, beyond the theoretical stance, the truth is that countries are able to\nexercise their sovereignty only in the function of their statehood; ergo, both concepts are\ninseparable. Indeed, as David Bederman asserts, the essence of statehood is sovereignty,\n“[...] the principle that each nation answers only to its own domestic order and is not\naccountable to a larger international community, save only to the extent it has consented to\ndo so”.314 The objective capability of nations to impose their power upon their population\nand territory, and interact with other international legal persons, therefore, lies in their\nstatehood and their exercise of sovereignty.\nFollowing this logic of reasoning, statehood would confer sufficient legitimacy on\ncountries to represent Nature’s interests in front of both local actors and other nations.\nNotwithstanding, it could eventually signify a restriction for environmental protection as\nwell, principally regarding judicial disputes. Effectively, the International Court of Justice\nconstitutes an example, given it only admits States as parties of trials. Moreover, according\nto its statute, the only non-state entities whose participation the ICJ accepts are the\ninternational public organisations that could contribute with relevant information to cases.\nIn practice, however, it does not change the status quo , but it just brings back the jurisdiction\nto the public ambit because States are usually members of those institutions. Consequently,\nas mentioned before, if the claims come from an entity other than the State, the ICJ simply\ndoes not start any procedure.315",

Also quoted by Garner (2004) 4360.\n315 Statute of the International Court of Justice (1945) Article 34 (1 and 2).\nAccordingly, this Court’s constraint becomes a factual barrier [to protect Nature]\nbecause the bulk of the potential claimants are usually out of the State’s field of action, i.e.,\nthey are individuals, non-governmental organisations, private companies or the like. The ICJ\ndoes not have jurisdiction in their cases. Indeed, Anthony Aust holds that people and\ninstitutions out of the state orbit submit approximately one thousand applications per year,\nwhich means more than five times-in just one year-the total number of 177 cases that the\nCourt has entered into its list between 1947 and 2019.316\nA conceivable alternative to overcome this hurdle, as the very Court recognises, consists\nof States take up the cases on behalf of their nationals and invoke their rights against other\nnations. Under this circumstance, despite its usefulness, the dispute continues to be in the\nexclusive sphere of States. In this line of reasoning, some time ago, Guenther Dahlhoff was\nexplaining the feasibility to avoid the obstacle of statehood through the application of article\nXII of the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization\n(ILO). According to this provision, the Governing Body of the ILO was entitled [it alone] to\nsubmit a question regarding the validity of the Tribunal’s decision to the advisory opinion\nof the ICJ. The Court’s opinion was curiously binding. This procedure, as Dahlhoff\naccurately pointed out, gave rise to the fact that “[...] advisory proceedings take the place\nof contentious proceedings which would not be possible under the Statute of the Court ”.317\nIn 2016, however, the General Conference of the ILO decided to repeal both article XII\nof the Tribunal’s Statute and article XII of its Annex “[...] to ensure equality of access to\njustice for employing institutions and officials alike ”. As part of the news, ILO’s\nspokespersons associated the amendment with an ICJ advisory opinion of 2012 concerning\nJudgement No. 2867. The alluded judgement No. 2867 referred to a dispute between the\nAdministrative Tribunal of the ILO and the International Fund for Agricultural Development\n(IFAD) regarding the payment of monetary compensation to an IFAD’s former staff\nmember. Consequently, this alternative does not exist anymore.318\nAnother valid [and in force] alternative would consist of bringing a suit [or being\nclaimed] before the Court of Justice of the European Union.

This mechanism allows a particular person\nor entity to sue to member States before the Court.322\nIn practice, the IACtHR has been much less active than European tribunals in\nenvironmental matters, as transpires from the information available on its website. Indeed,\nthey have recorded four cases in total, between 2004 and 2019, concerning community and\nindigenous claims. Thus, in April 2020, the International Justice Resource Centre strangely\nenough posted, as a piece of remarkable news, the first Court’s decision against Argentina\nregarding an environmental rights case. In its decision, the Court held Argentina responsible\nfor violating several human rights of the indigenous community of the Lhaka Honhat\nAssociation. Those entitlements included property, participation in government, progressive\ndevelopment, fair trial, juridical personality, freedom of thought and expression, freedom of\nassociation, and freedom of movement and residence.323\nIn terms of normative, the African system of human rights is somehow similar to the\nInter-American one, namely the Charter enshrines the right to a satisfactory general",

States do indeed have been\ntraditionally the only subjects of international law, which makes sense considering they have\ncreated the rules historically, by issuing the treaties or pursuing the custom, i.e., the\nfundamental sources of law, as Abass argues. Nevertheless, what was utterly understandable\nin an initial scenario of development, i.e., the existence of a law created for States to regulate\nStates, proves out to be inapplicable these days, perhaps even old-fashioned. As a\nconsequence, the range of international law has gradually widened in the contemporary\nworld, so that it is accurate to ponder also about the extension “[...] of its subjects to include\ninternational organizations and, in some cases human beings ”.325\nMalcolm Shaw coincides with the last assertion. In his opinion, the scope of\ninternational law has experienced an “ immense” expansion, beyond territory and\njurisdiction, since the middle of the twentieth century. It does not mean, though, its primary\naim had changed; it still grounds somehow on the “ international political system ”, whose\ncharacteristics of co-existence and hostility are typical of the general political systems.326\nFor him:",

    "text": "Pursuant to Abass, self-determination is one of the principles of contemporary international\nlaw, which consists of the “[...] ability of a people to govern themselves, a process that must\nbe preceded by the people being able to form an independent State ”. In its most basic form,\nit is directly associated with statehood because, as Crawford suggests, self-determination\ndeals with a principle concerned with the right to be a State.328\nThe historical transcendence of self-determination, principally in recent years, spread\naround the globe, allowing its inclusion in the 1945-U.N. Charter as one of the fundamental\nprinciples supporting the development of friendly relations among States. In the words of\nLung-Chu Chen, it has been the “[...] driving force behind the rapid and vast proliferation\nof new states after World War II ”. Further developments occurred in practice, Kilangi\nasserts, in the wake of a request coming from the General Assembly, for the U.N.\nCommission on Human Rights, to prepare recommendations concerning international\nrespect for the right of peoples to self-determination.329\nAfter 1945, as Professor Crawford points out, diverse theoretical tendencies debated\nabout whether self-determination was a principle or a legal right. The discussion evoked\n“changes in the political geography of the world ”, emphasising the fact that the adoption of\nan overtly political principle could raise worries about the character of international law and\nthe justiciability of political disputes. Ultimately, however, it seems the international legal\ninstruments tipped the scales in favour of the second option, considering both covenants\nenshrined self-determination as a right of people. They lay down: “ All peoples have the right\nof self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and\nfreely pursue their economic, social and cultural development ”.330\nIn context, the power to govern diverse spheres of development should include the\nmanagement of natural resources, according to their advisability. One could corroborate this\naspect through the reading of the second paragraph of the covenants’ first articles, already\nquoted, regarding the disposition of the State’s natural wealth and resources. In this case,\ncountries virtually operate as owners, predicated on their authority to decide what to do with\ntheir natural assets [so to speak].",

Self-determination seemingly has\nrestrictions regarding especially the avoidance of harming any commitment derived from\ninternational regulations or economic cooperation, grounded on the principle of mutual\nbenefit. In any case, as one can see, the exercise of the right to self-determination is not much\ndifferent from the use of conventional property, that is, there are liberties with certain\nlimitations. Beyond the hair-splitting of legal classifications, some authors reaffirm that\nNature constitutes the property of individuals, legal entities (public and private) and States\nin the field of international law.331\nConcomitantly, the interrelation between States and Nature, in terms of a sort of\nproperty, as it were, shows up even more evidently through the so-called “ principle of\npermanent sovereignty over natural resources ” addressed above. This tenet “[...] has its\nroots in the claim for self-determination of [especially] newly independent States and in the\nquestion of economic development of developing countries [...]”. As Hobe argues, the\nprerogative of independence, firmly alleged by developing countries, rarely is claimed alone.\nIt is usually proclaimed joint with territorial sovereignty and self-determination. The\nexercise of all these entitlements altogether seems to endow States with a kind of\ndiscretionary privilege to make decisions concerning their environment. Therefore, as Hobe\nconcludes, “[...] the core of this principle is the territorial sovereignty of any State over its\n[natural] resources and the obvious entitlement to decide within the confines of international\nlaw, how to deal with these resources ”.332\nNonetheless, as pointed out above, the exercise of national sovereignty over the territory\nis not utterly free, owing to the existence of some constraints, which are primarily\ndetermined by “ sovereign equality ”. Thus, resolution No. 1803 (XVII) sets out that: “ The\nfree and beneficial exercise of the sovereignty of peoples and nations over their natural\nresources must be furthered by the mutual respect of States based on their sovereign\nequality”. There exists concordance between the “ mutual benefit ” (of the Economic and\nPolitical covenants) with the “ mutual respect ” (of the declaration coming from resolution\nNo. 1803). In the end, they are just two different ways to express somehow the same idea.333",

Regarding the specific case of energy\nresources, see Nanda and Pring (2013) 236-8.\n332 Hobe (2015) 1 and 11.\n333 U.N.G.A. Resolution No. 1803 (XVII) (1962) para. 5th.\nTo recapitulate, as one can notice, the exercise of state sovereignty to dispose of natural\nresources as appropriate gets visualised through self-determination, i.e., the power to rule\nthe “state belongings ” willingly. This prerogative induces States to experience a sense of\nfreedom, even independence in front of other pairs. Consequently, it is undeniable the\nexistence of a concurrent interplay among sovereignty, self-determination, and\nindependence, whose implications get showed in the manner how every country manages its\nnatural resources.\nIn practice, however, the amalgam among the mentioned trilogy (sovereignty/selfdetermination/independence) has not been adequately carried out. In effect, Hunter,\nSalzman, and Zaelke explain there has been a “[...] fundamental tension between a State’s\ninterest in protecting its independence (i.e., its sovereignty) and the recognition that certain\nproblems, in this case regional and global environmental problems, require international\ncooperation ”. In the same vein, Abass shares this assertion pointing out that the development\nof international law has been “ painstakingly slow ”. The reason does not only lie in the\nintricate qualities of green regulations, the difficulties in detecting ecological impacts, and\nso on but also it is due to international laws ground on compliance, which requires\nenforcement. “ The very notion of enforcement makes States very uncomfortable, [Abass\nargues] since they see it as a violation of their sovereignty by other States, which are equal\nto them in the eyes of international law ”. Consequently, States usually see environmental\nnormative as an intrusion into their sovereignty.334\nBy way of criticism, nevertheless, one should argue that the exercise of selfdetermination, the defence of national sovereignty, and the assertion of independence in\nfront of other States do not apply for all countries or all circumstances equally, at least, in\npractice. Moreover, sometimes the very existence of legal personality is not even enough to\nStates bring their rights to bear in the international arena. Most of the cases, it depends on\nthe real power or influence a nation can exert over others, which means that a lot of “ small”\ncountries are not able to claim for the respect of their rights or interests in the same conditions\nas their pairs. The effect of this restriction is particularly meaningful in environmental\nmatters because it usually entails a new barrier against the protection of Nature. To illustrate\nthe described situation, by way of example, it would be worth mentioning the recognition of\nthe International Court of Justice’s jurisdiction in all legal disputes.

The\nuse of the verb “ may” could lead to the thinking that this acknowledgement is optional.\nNevertheless, as Anthony Aust explains, the fact that all U.N. members are parties of the\nstatute, without any other requirement, does not mean they had accepted the intervention of\nthe Court to decide any dispute regarding them and other U.N. members. “ As with any other\ninternational tribunal, [Aust asserts] the Court can exercise jurisdiction only if that has been\nconferred on it by the parties ”.335\nAccordingly, even if Nature were in serious jeopardy, neither the assertion of national\nsovereignty and self-determination nor the accomplishment of the requirements of statehood\nand legal standing per se would be sufficient to exercise environmental rights or to act on\ntheir behalf. Whether the concerned State has not recognised the Court’s jurisdiction, the\nintervention of the ICJ would not be valid. It occurred in 2014 when the Republic of the\nMarshall Islands filed an application against a set of nations that, in its opinion, possessed\nnuclear weapons, i.e., China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of\nAmerica, among others, invoking the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT).\nIn parenthesis, no threat against humanity and the environment in the world today is\nprobably as grave as the uncontrollable propagation of atomic energy without peaceful ends.\nFor this reason, several states adopted the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, aimed mainly\nat avoiding the transfer, reception, assistance to introduce, or encouragement and induction\nto use any kind of nuclear weapons or explosive devices.336\nThe Marshall Islands accessed the Treaty in 1995. Within the defendants instead, the\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had ratified the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty in 1968; likewise, the United States of America and the Russian Federation did it in\n1970; while China and France accessed to the Treaty in 1992.

Nonetheless, having declared the compulsory\nrecognition of the Court’s jurisdiction in 1969, only the case against the United Kingdom\ninitially entered to General List, while the other cases were not even taken into account,\nowing to the lack of the said declaration. Later, the U.K.’s recognition had two amendments\nin 2014 and 2017. Likewise, the cases against Pakistan and India entered the list as well,\nhaving admitted the Court’s jurisdiction in 1960 and 1974, respectively. A new Pakistan’s\nrecognition in 2017 revoked the old one, and the same happened with India’s declaration in\n2019.

As mentioned, however, countries should\nnot exert their authority limitless but get framed on the respect of their pairs’ rights, which\nprimarily consists of avoiding any harm in foreign territory.\nThus, the respect of the others’ rights materialises through the so-called principle “ sic\nutere tuo ut alienum non laedas ”, meaning “ use your own property in such a manner as not\nto injure that of another ”, according to Brunnée. The scope of this tenet corresponds to the\ntransnational implications of environmental harm in other national circumscriptions. Some\nauthors, such as Oppenheim and Sands, usually identify it with the principle of “ good faith ”\nor “good-neighbourliness ” as well, associated with the idea of cooperation.

Save the Convention on Biological Diversity, the bulk of binding\ninternational treaties include this statement solely within their preambles, not within their\noperative sections.341\nEvery state is the key responsible for the environmental policy and management of its\nnatural resources within its very jurisdiction, especially since the signature of the 1972Stockholm Declaration. Nevertheless, when state actions have potentially trans-boundary\neffects over the other’s territory, including ecosystems, the aforesaid environmental\nmanagement turns out virtually impossible without the notion of cooperation [mutually\nrespectable] among countries. This “ cooperation ” encompasses the general idea regarding\nthe restrictions of permanent sovereignty.342 At present, nevertheless, other provisions lay\ndown measures of cooperation to face the environmental crisis. Annexe # 3.8 shows a brief\nscheme.\nThe normative origins of the cooperation principle are not exactly environmental ones.\nThey refer either to the social, economic, and commercial wellbeing of the other countries\nor nations, pursuing the U.N. Charter.343 Likewise, the judgement about the famous “ Corfu\nChannel case ”, issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has also played a\nsubstantial role in the development of this principle. In effect, the Corfu Channel dispute\ncomprises a British claim against Albania regarding the harm of two vessels and the death\nof various members of the crews, due to the explosion of mines in Albanian territorial waters\nof the Corfu Channel in 1946. The ICJ held Albania liable for the damages and deaths,\ngrounded mostly on the government’s knowledge of the minelaying and the omission of its\nauthorities to prevent the disaster, namely lack of cooperation.344 Some years later, the U.N.\nGeneral Assembly included the principle into two of the most remarkable environmental\ninstruments of soft law at a global level, i.e., Stockholm and Rio declarations.345",

The Court\naffirmed explicitly: “ The existence of the general obligation of States to ensure that activities\nwithin their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States or of areas\nbeyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the\nenvironment ”.347 However, the Court’s general opinion was riskily vague in practice, given\nthe conclusions about the lack of customary or conventional law that prohibited the\npossession or use of nuclear weapons. In other words, it means somehow the possibility to\nbring about any potential damages-not only environmental ones-in the territory of other\nstates.\nTherefore, in the environmental ambit, neither the principle of cooperation nor the noharm rule seems to work out equally for all countries, at least in practice. As limits of\nsovereignty, both aspects should contribute to protecting Nature, given that they avoid any\nundesirable intromission within the territories of other States. Nonetheless, most of the time\nthe adequate application of these tenets of international law relies on external circumstances,\nonce again, such as the range of influence exerted by a specific country over others or the\nstrategic interest upon determined natural resources. As announced before, one can find an\naccurate illustration of this last assertion by revisiting the Marshall Islands’ experiences\nbefore the International Court of Justice. In parenthesis, by way of clarification, some\nauthors employ better-known exemplifications to describe the scope of the interplay between\nsovereignty and cooperation, such as Corfu Channel (U.K. v. Albania) or Nuclear Tests",

About the same topic, see also Leib (2011) 118; Dailey (2000) 337-8.\n347 Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (1996) p. 226, 241-2, 266-7 (emphasis added).\n(Australia v. France).348 In this case, though, it would seem the examination of a procedure,\nin which one can notice the different weight or capacity of influence among countries, could\nbe a more accurate academic contribution.\nTo recapitulate, as mentioned in the last section, the Marshall Islands had brought a\nlawsuit against nine countries for avoiding negotiations in good faith to cease the nuclear\narms race and lead to nuclear disarmament. Ultimately, the ICJ decided to include only three\nseparate cases into the general list: U.K., India, and Pakistan, i.e., those cases in which the\ndefendants had recognised the Court’s jurisdiction.\nBeyond the reasons exposed by the Marshall Islands and the arguments alluded to by\nthe three defendants, objectively speaking, it would be possible to explain or even hint the\nclaimant’s trepidation by arguing its territory had already been a location for nuclear tests in\nthe past (between 1946 and 1958). Likewise, its inhabitants had experienced the\nconsequences of radiation exposure.349 It did not mean the atomic tests were necessarily\ngoing to occur once again within Marshall Islands’ territory. However, the possibility was\nlatent, above all, considering both the antecedents and the suspicions about India and\nPakistan undertaking certain nuclear activities around the claim’s time.350\nAlthough the described facts could objectively get discussed as a potential threat to the\nplaintiff’s survival, the Court did not do it because it decided to reject the lawsuit, supporting\nthe first preliminary objections to jurisdiction, based on the “ absence of a dispute ”.\nConsequently, one is not able to know what the Court’s decision about the merits would\nhave been, and it probably would also be challenging to infer so. In either event, the\nargument turned out to be an effective legal strategy for the three defendants’ interests,\nbecause they could quash the indictment without proceeding to the merits.351 To understand\nthe situation comprehensively, nonetheless, it would be worth wondering what the “ absence\nof a dispute ” means.\nTo all intents and purposes, a legal dispute constitutes a traditional concept within the\nrealm of international law, whose origins could trace back even in the files of the Permanent\nCourt of International Justice (PCIJ), the predecessor of the ICJ. Indeed, Ademola Abass has",

In addition, one could also describe legal disputes in terms of the “[...]\nopposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance of certain\ntreaty obligations ”, following a more recent ICJ’s criterion coming from a 1950-advisory\nopinion. Finally, Abass has also pointed out that the existence of a contentious case is not\nenough to speak about a dispute. Regarding a couple of 1962-cases in South West Africa,\nthe writer-quoting the Court-has asserted that it “[...] must be shown that the claim of one\nparty is positively opposed by the other ”. After reviewing the definitions, due to the legal\nconnotation of the cases, it is worth mentioning the notion of the legal dispute does not seem\nto include at all any potential intention to harm, such as threats or menaces, understood in\ntheir more straightforward sense (e.g., in a dictionary form) in the field of international\nlaw.352 Nevertheless, within other branches of law, one should also argue any kind of\nintimidation often constitutes a component of unlawful and proscribed conducts and even of\ncrimes.\nConsequently, if there is not a disagreement on points of law or facts, or a conflict of\nlegal views or interests, or opposite opinions concerning a specific legal obligation, one can\naffirm it deals with an “ absence of a dispute ”. Moreover, as a complementary criterion, the\nexistence of threats would neither constitute a dispute.\nIn context, while it is true, the applicant’s core procedural deficiency could probably\nconsist of having been unable to prove the existence of a dispute, the character of the Court’s\nreasoning is also pretty debatable in the judiciary sphere. With respect to the first point, one\ncan notice an evident lack of forcefulness in the Marshall Islands’ argument. In essence, their\nrepresentatives supported their allegations in three fundamental aspects: (1) what themselves\nhad proclaimed in international forums, (2) the very filing of the application and the ensuing\npositions of the parties, and (3) the defendants’ conduct both before and after the filing of",

The most recurrent criticisms\nconsisted of (1) the Court required the respondents had to be “ aware” that their views were\n“positively opposed ” by the applicant, which somehow implied a shift of the traditional\nconcept of dispute; (2) the inclusion of new requirements into the definition of a dispute did\nnot correspond to the jurisprudence of the ICJ; and (3) the Court did not consider the\ncustomary nature of Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which the claimant based\nits suit on, implying the real existence of a conflictive situation.354\nMoreover, the own results of the voting were quite demonstrative regarding\ndisagreements among the judges and illustrated how difficult was defining the absence of a\ndispute.

It is probably one of the reasons why the dispute’s concept does not seem\nto include threats, not even imminent ones. Indeed, the Court rejected the lawsuit despite the\nfact that it recognised the potential menace, arguing the Marshall Islands, “[...] by virtue of\nthe suffering which its people endured as a result of it being used as a site for extensive\nnuclear testing programs, [had] special reasons for concern about nuclear disarmament ”.\nCuriously, the Court used the expression “ special reasons for concern ”, instead of “ interest”,\nwhich would also apply accurately in this case. Nonetheless, one should recall the ICJ was\navoiding any reference to the existence of “ a conflict of legal interests ” because it constituted\na component of the dispute’s definition.357\nTo some extent, when one comprehensively analyses the Court’s reasoning, it is\npossible to find out a clear-cut contrast with its prior view concerning the legality of the\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons, expressed through a 1996-Advisory Opinion. The ICJ\nreplied unanimously to the U.N. General Assembly that “[t] here exists an obligation to\npursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament\nin all its aspects under strict and effective international control ” [sic]. The Court did not\ninterestingly clarify if this obligation was applicable or not to those countries that are not\npart of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, i.e., exactly one of the claimant’s arguments.358\nMoreover, if one reads between the lines, one could infer the applicant brought its\nclaims, not least because it took for granted the respondents possessed nuclear armaments\n(including those nations whose proceedings did not get included in the ICJ’s general list).\nThis fact involved other controversial actors in the scenario, e.g., North Korea, which\nimplied a severe environmental risk in practice. Accordingly, it turned out indisputable the\nexistence of an ecological menace at that time, not only against the petitioner and its territory,\nbut also against the international community and, of course, the planet. It is sufficient to take\na glance at the news about North Korea from 2013 on to realise the earnest of the situation",

By way of\nexample, despite the fact that Nigerian law imposed the enforcement of international\nstandards for the oil exploitation within its territory, one of the board members of the\ntransnational SHELL U.K. Limited recognised, during an annual meeting in 1997, that the\napplication of “[...] higher environmental standards could harm local economies ”. To him,\na more expensive operation would not only be uncompetitive, but it would also deprive “[...]\nthe local work-force of jobs and the chance to development ”.364 Then, it turns out too\nambiguous-and even paradoxical-that the disjunction between environmental and\ndevelopmental reasons to make a public decision could tilt towards economic aims, under\nthe same discursive influence often used to justify a solely eco-friendly measure.\nIleana Porras remarks the insertion of what had been formerly the principle 21st of the\nStockholm Declaration (1972) into the upcoming Rio Declaration (1992) or the Convention\non Climate Change (1992), whose contents are identical. It provoked a series of criticisms\nas well as favourable opinions. On the one hand, developed countries were reluctant to the\ninclusion of the whole paragraph due to its redundancy, above all considering the Stockholm\nDeclaration’s principles were going to be reaffirmed within the Rio Declaration’s preamble.\nOn their part, developing nations, primarily gathered in the G77, were insistent about the\naddition of the text, including the phrase “ and developmental ”, given they were particularly\nafraid of potential globalisation of natural resources, such as tropical forests, a recurrent\ntheme within the developed countries’ rhetoric. Other authors, such as Foo and Taylor, have\na similar interpretation about the developing countries’ unwillingness to accept a potential\nviolation of the state sovereignty over their natural resources and a decline of their\ndevelopment.365\nMoreover, Porras herself explains that natural resources become common goods of\nhumanity under this “ new globalising rhetoric ”, which turns the State a guardian of its\nresources, on behalf of the planet, that is, the restriction to exploit natural resources\nconsidering exclusively environmental motives flies in the face of the traditional conception\nof sovereignty.

In other words, it meant passing from a condition\nof a kind of state ownership to a trusteeship, where every governmental action regarding\nnatural resources should “[...] consider the interests of, and probably consult with, the\ninternational community before taking any action affecting the resource ”.366\nThis last reasoning widely coincides with the argument asserting that the classical\nconcept of sovereignty depicts somehow a species of property, exclusively exercised by\nnations over their resources. Furthermore, it constitutes another way to affirm the natural\nresources are to satisfy human interests, which turns out a clear-cut anthropocentric outlook.\nIn more detail, the debate regarding the inclusion of the referred phrase has focused\nmainly on the effect of having reaffirmed traditional sovereignty over green considerations\nor having put them at the same level, at least. Thus, while some authors saw positively how\nthe Declaration equated environmental and developmental policies and rights,367 others\nreplicated more gravely that the change was a “ skillfully masked ”368 or even “ a\nreactionary ”369 step backwards.\nAmong the latter, Pallemaerts inquisitively elaborates his argument, assuring there was\na disruption of the “[...] delicate balance struck in Stockholm between the sovereign use of\nnatural resources and the duty of care for the environment ”. On her part, Leib emphasises\nthe idea of state sovereignty as a hindrance to the implementation of public environmental\npolicies, weighing up the suggestive Judge Weeramantry’s speech, in which he affirms that\nstates should surrender part of their sovereignty in favour of the environment and\nforthcoming generations.370\nAdditionally, there is a sort of neutral position, in which authors do not emit any\nprofound critical comment about the tenet at issue, but instead assume an analytical stance\nrelating to the function of state sovereignty over natural resources, from an insight of\ncustomary law.371 Sands, for example, believes this shift reflected merely an “ instant”\nvariation in the rule of customary international law.

The fact\nthat the Convention on Biological Diversity has been agreed during the same 1992Conference, where the Convention on Climate Change and the Rio Declaration were\naccorded as well, reinforces Sands’ argument, owing to the last instruments do include the\nalready referred phrase “ and developmental ”.\nOther allusions regarding exclusively environmental policies (and excluding\ndevelopmental ones) can be found, for example, in the Vienna Convention for the Protection\nof the Ozone Layer or in the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial\nAccidents. Likewise, some further mentions regarding both environmental and\ndevelopmental policies are, for example, in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic\nPollutants, in the Protocol on Water and Health to the 1992 Convention on the Protection\nand Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, and in a couple of U.N.\nresolutions (1994/65 and 1995/14).373\nIn context, there are two cases one should emphasise, given the highly contradictory\ncharacter of the theme. Firstly, the case of the “ Non-legally binding authoritative statement\nof principles for a global consensus on the management, conservation and sustainable\ndevelopment of all types of forests ” is quite curious due to its ambiguousness. Even though\nthe statement contains a verbatim text to the Stockholm Declaration’s one, i.e., excluding\nthe reference to development,374 it promotes it at the same time, actively highlighting on\ndevelopmental needs, including socio-economic and even sustainable nuances.

    "text": "375 ibid Principle 2 (a).\n376 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (1979) Recital 5th; Protocol to the 1979 Convention\nConvention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (1998) Recital 8th;\nProtocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification,\nEutrophication and Ground-level Ozone (1999) Recital 12th.\nHence, the first research question searched for corroborating if it is true or not that the\ninternational legal framework, currently in force, merely considers Nature as a set of\ngoods subject to property . The response did not set off from scratch, because there was an\nassumption concerning Nature does constitute an array of things and commodities, an aspect\nanalysed and somehow concluded in the previous chapter. Consequently, once reviewed the\nmost noteworthy binding and non-binding instruments of international law, currently in\neffect, one can indubitably determine that Nature is thoroughly susceptible to be the property\nof human beings.\nEffectively, everything that exists on Earth, especially lands and species, belong to\nhuman beings, either by private means or public ones. Moreover, the international legal\nframework, from the older instruments to the more recent ones, is littered with references to\nproperty rights over Nature. As mentioned, the very fact that some conventions contain\nallusions to “ natural resources ”, instead of other expressions, such as Nature, environment,\nor ecosystem, for example, evokes the ideas of commodification and objectification of the\nwild, i.e., the conceptualisation of flora, fauna and ecosystems as goods, things or\ncommodities. In this line of reasoning, the Conventions on biodiversity, climate change,\naccess to information, and combating desertification allude to biological, genetic, water or\nland resources, indistinctly. In some way, they have followed the course set by earlier\ntreaties, such as the economic and political covenants, which established the people’s right\nto fully and freely exploit and use their natural resources.\nIn particular, the influence of the covenants concerning the handle of Nature has turned\nout decisive, not least because they defined the overall conditions of the so-called principle\nof permanent sovereignty over natural resources. As a result, one of the most powerful\nconclusions derived from the present analysis consists of the fact that the exercise of State\nsovereignty grants to nations a legal right easily comparable with property rights, that is, in\npractice, countries participate as owners of Nature in the international sphere but sheltered\nand supported by the normative framework.\nAs announced in the first pages of the chapter, the examination of property rights over\nNature was going to be guided by the ownership’s constituent elements, i.e., possession, use,\nand disposition. In consequence, pursuant to the mentioned structure, this chapter counts on\na compilation in detail of plentiful legal exemplifications regarding ownership upon natural\nresources. Thus, the commerce of wild species, regulated by the CITES, represents perhaps\nthe archetype of Nature as merchandise, where its purchase and sale pursue the logic of\ntraditional property rights. Nevertheless, the trade of endangered species is not the only\nregulation of the international market, given there is a series of provisions oriented to protect\nit. Sundry treaties even bring into question any restriction of international trade, based on\nenvironmental measures, or promote greater flexibility in the application of green actions to\nthose countries tending to market economies. Within this commercial ambit, the Convention\nto Combat Desertification plays a controversial role, by warranting to the owners of\ntraditional knowledge and know-how the economic profits derived from their uses and\ntechnological applications. As mentioned, any potential commercialisation of ancestral\npractices and native cultural elements, such as folk medicine, for example, could represent\na threat to the very survival of indigenous peoples.\nAnother remarkable result concerns the incontrovertible association between poverty\nand environmental degradation, being property rights, once again, the common thread\nrunning within both aspects. In context, several economic experts, and even sundry\nconventions causally link poverty with the environmental crisis through the failures or the\nlack of property rights accurately defined. The response coming from the international legal\nframework, however, seems to be a little bit confusing. Some treaties usually propose\neconomic growth as a valid response to ecological problems despite the fact that various\ncritics of economic growth often consider it as the root of environmental catastrophe.\nIn practice, it is possible to describe the interplay between any failures or lack of\nproperty rights with poverty, and with the environmental detriment (characterised by the free\naccess). Nonetheless, the interconnections between poverty and environmental problems are\nnot always clear-cut and determinant. It is probably the reason why does not permanently\nwork out the attempts to employ similar solutions for both situations. In other words, as\nasserted throughout the correspondent section, the continuous breakdown of environmental\npolicies, grounded on economic growth, shows how the application of anthropocentric\nmeasures upon ecological problems does not always succeed.\nOn the other hand, the second research query attempted to establish the pecking order\nbetween Nature and ownership. In plain language, the question looked for determining if\nproperty rights are more important than Nature in the light of international law in force .\nThe answer, however, cannot tilt the balance toward one side or another thoroughly, as one\ncould easily infer from reviewing the whole chapter. Admittedly, for example, several\npassages of the law denote a strong predominance of international trade over Nature, which\nconstitutes in itself a confirmation of the hypothesis. Still, one cannot entirely assure the\ntreaties bias toward the prevalence of property rights regarding other themes, such as\noverexploitation or pollution on private property, for instance. As explained, various\nconventions forbid any kind of restriction of global commerce in the name of environmental\npolicies and measures. Moreover, they even promote the flexibility of their actions in favour\nof the market economy. Nevertheless, it is not the general principle operating for all other\ncases, where green issues are of greater importance.\nIn practice, the environmental instruments declare as their objectives diverse ranges of\nthe protection of Nature and struggle against critical ecological problems, such as pollution,\nglobal warming, desertification, among others. Moreover, it draws attention to how the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights has invoked property rights to decide more than 15% of\nthe “green” case law.\nA further element of analysis, derived from the exercise of state sovereignty, consists of\nthe disjunction between the application of environmental or developmental policies to use\nand exploit natural resources. In one way or another, there was a preponderance of ecological\nmotivations supporting any country’s decision to utilise their natural resources until 1992,\nat least in discursive terms. Nonetheless, after the Earth Summit, where some of the most\nsignificant international binding and non-binding instruments in matters of environmental\nlaw came out, the legal and academic discourses dramatically shifted. Effectively, the\ninclusion of the phrase “ and developmental ”, within the clauses regarding the sovereign\nexploitation of natural resources, constitutes an inflexion point. The reason was that\ndevelopmental policy became a justification for exploiting Nature comparable with the\nenvironmental one, i.e., at the same level.\nAs a result, the decision to exploit national ecosystems entirely depends on States,\npredicated on environmental or developmental reasons, an aspect that could have\nrepercussions on the hierarchical position of property rights over Nature, given that\ndevelopment gets often associated with economic growth and commerce. Therefore, from\nthis point of view, the potential supremacy of ownership over Nature is uncertain and\nambiguous. One should warn, additionally, that the bulk of treaties issued from 1992 include\nthis option within their texts merely as a part of their preambles and not of operative sections.\nTo recapitulate, there cannot be a determinant conclusion regarding the prevalence of\nproperty rights over Nature because, despite there is evidence of the supremacy of the\ninternational market in sundry green treaties, it does not deal with a general principle\ngoverning the interactions between humans and Nature. Furthermore, the responsibility to\nchoose between the application of environmental and developmental policies to use and\nexploit natural resources corresponds to each State. It means that every country is\naccountable for deciding what aspect is more important. Under this circumstance, the\ninternational legal framework does not play any role to determine pecking orders, in which\nproperty rights occupy a higher position than Nature. Other local or global entities and\npersons are neither liable, solely the States.\nUltimately, although the present chapter did not include any hypothesis concerning the\nrepresentation of Nature, the analysis of sundry elements of state sovereignty, such as\nstatehood, self-determination, and cooperation, it allowed arriving at complementary\nconclusions in this subject matter. Thus, one of the findings coming from the previous\nchapter consisted of bringing into question the historical capacity of States to act on behalf\nof Nature. The main criticism had to do with the responsibility of States to protect human\nrights and natural resources at the same time. The argument was that it would turn out\nvirtually unviable to believe that States were knowingly going to enforce the international\nlegal framework in favour of Nature and detriment to humans if the case. This presumption\nwas focussing primarily on the judicial interventions of countries before the international\ntribunals of justice, although it could also apply to their participation within the global\ncommunity.\nNotwithstanding, it seems to be evident that the fact of accomplishing all the\nrequirements to be recognised as a sovereign State-i.e., statehood, self-determination,\nindependence, and so forth-is neither sufficient to exercise the right to protect the national\necosystems. The analysis of the lawsuit brought by the Marshall Islands against a group of\nnations, alleging they have not pursued negotiations in good faith to cease the atomic arms\nrace and go forth the nuclear disarmament, proved it. Curiously, one of the criticisms against\nthe jurisdiction’s restriction imposed by International Court of Justice deals with allowing\nclaims coming only from States, setting aside other participants, such as NGOs,\nconfederations, or human beings, for example. They could even represent better off Nature’s\ninterests most of the time. Nonetheless, the mentioned experience demonstrated that not even\nthe sovereign States are capable of protecting the environment under unfavourable legal\ncircumstances.\nAnother deduction hailing from the examination of sovereignty refers to the inequalities\nin the application of principles of international law. Sometimes, for instance, the tenet of\ncooperation or the no-harm rule in environmental matters only works out when the country\nthat alleges its enforcement counts on enough political [or perhaps economic] influence to\nattain it. Otherwise, it could be useless.\nSumming up, the legality of statehood, the strength of self-determination, and the\nwarranty of state independence do not confer legitimacy to represent Nature’s interests, in\npractice. At best, one should admit that, under adequate legal conditions, States [and even\nother entities or people] could have success acting on behalf of Nature. Still, one also ought\nto keep in mind that States could opt for the defence of property rights or the promotion of\ndevelopment, affecting directly or indirectly conservation and protection of Nature.\nMoreover, one has to recall that the State is in charge of the local administration of justice,\nwhich usually would place it in the position of judge and jury, discrediting its environmental\nactions.",

    "text": "Depending on the context, the fact that a judge considers property rights as more important\nthan environmental ones could imply innumerable interpretations. At first glance,\nnevertheless, those members of the Court of Justice of the European Union who participated\nin the preliminary ruling requested by the High Court of Justice from England and Wales, in\n1999, seem to disagree. In effect, the request took place in the framework of two cases among\nHarry Auger Standley, David George Metson, and others v. the Secretary of State for the\nEnvironment and others . The CJEU expressly upheld thereon that “[...] while the right to\n3%European\n11%Foundations/Organisations\n1%\n7%\n33%States\n45%\nproperty forms part of the general principles of Community law, it is not an absolute right\nand must be viewed in relation to its social function ”.378\nFrom the outset, the Court held a clear-cut opinion against the prevalence of property\nrights over Nature, to the point of rejecting the plaintiffs’ argument. They claimed that the\ndeclaration by which the British public authorities had identified the rivers Waveney,\nBlackwater, Chelmer, and their tributaries as waters which could be affected by agricultural\npollution infringed their right to property. Likewise, they were at odds with the designation\nof areas of land draining into those waters as vulnerable zones because they believed it\nbrought about the same harmful effects against the property on their farms. According to the\nowners, both governmental actions restricted the agricultural use of their lands. Moreover,\nalthough it explicitly recognised that the application of some measures restricted the farmers\nactually from exercising their property rights, the Court affirmed that those constraints\ncorresponded “[...] to objectives of general interest pursued by the Community and [did]\nnot constitute a disproportionate and intolerable interference [...]”.379\nWithin the technical context in which the British Tribunal raised their questions, the\nquery concerning property rights did not occupy a predominant place. Notwithstanding, for\nthe research’s purpose, both the legal arguments and the European directives alluded to in\nthe judgement turn out useful to discuss the legal implications of the dichotomy between\nproperty rights and Nature.\nIn this sense, when one reads the measures to be adopted by landowners, in the\nframework of the action programmes established in Annex III of the so-called Nitrates\nDirective,380 it turns out undeniable they represent a limitation to property rights. In practice,\nthe measures taken by the Secretary of State, especially the establishment of vulnerable\nzones within the boundaries of the claimants’ lands do factually affect their economic\ninterests.381 Although there is not an explicit reference within the judgement, it is not hard\nto imagine those farms will undergo a drop in value because no farmer would purchase them\nwith a restriction concerning agricultural activities, at least with the cost they had before the\ndecision. In the same line of reasoning, the constraints concerning pollution constitute an\nincrease in the expenses, which affects the incomes coming from their farming business.",

It pretends to affirm that the restrictions to the exercise of\nproperty rights are a real given instead. In other words, an eco-friendly policy-justified or\nnot-could bring about detriments to owners. It is what the Court has called the social function\nof property, and its application determines a tension between property rights and protection\nof Nature, materialised through the idea of preventing the pollution of water. Nevertheless,\nit is not the only case. For example, parallel interpretations would apply to the special\nconditions provided for the storage and use of livestock manure.382\nFrom the reading of the arguments alluded to by the British High Court of Justice in\norder to require the preliminary ruling, however, one could infer its opinion was closer to\nthe applicants’, this is, the British judges did believe that the Nitrates Directive infringed the\nright to property of farmers. In fact, the fashion in which they asked their questions was quite\nsuggestive owing to the expected conditional interpretation [by the British Court] regarding\nthe identification of waters affected by pollution and the subsequent designation of\nvulnerable areas. They perhaps aspired both measures had only been taken “[...] where the\ndischarge of nitrogen compounds from agricultural sources itself accounts for a\nconcentration of nitrates in those waters in excess of 50 mg/l (i.e., leaving out of account\nany contribution from other sources) ”.383 Otherwise, i.e., less than 50 mg/l, it would be an\ninfringement of the right to property.

While it is true that, it should be recognised, the Court\ndecided in favour of Nature, the lack of a committed defence of its interests would lead\naprioristically to thinking about the need to count on a representative.\nAnother example about the pre-eminence of green reasoning over property rights,\ngrounded on the social function of ownership, can also be found among the rulings by the\nGeneral Court.

Consequently, those suspensions or delays of activities infringe property rights.392\nIn response, following the same pattern of the previous judgements, the Court denied\nthe respondent’s argument, clarifying one more time that property rights are not absolute,\nthey must get exercised in their social function, and they correspond to objectives of general\ninterest, among other arguments. Furthermore, it explicitly declared that: “ Protection of the\nenvironment is one of those objectives and is therefore capable of justifying a restriction on\nthe exercise of the right to property ”.393\nIn a certain sense, it calls attention the stance adopted by the United Kingdom regarding\nthis point, favouring openly the economic interests above public participation, which in the\nend constitutes an environmental dimension. As one could see also in the first case of this\nsubsection, Standley, Metson, and others v. Minister of Agriculture and others (Case C293/97), the possibility to bring actions before the CJEU depicts somehow more\nindependence in the administration of justice. Nonetheless, although the participation of the\nCourt seemed more decisive in this case-one should recognise it-there remains a subtle\ndemand for representation on behalf of the ecological interests.\nAmong the analysed cases within this subsection, Arcelor SA v. European Parliament\nand Council of the European Union (2010) is probably the best example of a dispute\nbetween property rights and environmental protection. In the main, the application aimed at\na twofold objective. On the one hand, the company requested the annulment of a directive\nconcerning the establishment of a system for trading allowances concerning greenhouse gas\nemissions within the European Union. And, on the other hand, it also demanded\ncompensation for the damage suffered for the adoption of that directive.394\nIn context, Arcelor SA is a steel producer, raised from the merge of several companies.\nDuring the proceedings, among other arguments, it held that lawmakers did not take into\naccount the economic impacts concerning its activities by issuing the Directive 2003/87/EC.\nThe gist of its assertion was the defendants did not include in Annex I to the contested\ndirective the competing non-ferrous metals and chemicals sectors.

It is worth clarifying this directive experienced several amendments\nbetween 2003 and 2018. One can find a list of them and the consolidated version of the Directive 2003/87/EC\nin EUR Lex (2018) 1ff.\nclaimed the infringement of its property rights owing to neither the European Parliament nor\nthe Council envisaged “[...] the technical and economic impossibility for steel producers to\nreduce CO 2 emissions any further ”. Moreover, the applicant adduced the directive did not\ninclude any control mechanism regarding the price or the cross-border transfer of allowances\nwithin similar companies. In consequence, that lack of transfer options was going to impact\nseverely the company’s structuring efforts and competitiveness, and hence its property\nrights.395\nThe response of the Court was not unknown. As already mentioned, its members usually\naddress their findings firstly recognising that “[...] the right to property and the freedom to\npursue an economic activity form part of the general principles of Community law [...]”.\nNonetheless, among other reasons, those rights are not absolute and should get exercised\nrespecting their social function and the general interest. Of course, environmental matters\nconstitute “ general interest ”. In other words, once again, the Court often endows the highest\nimportance to environmental issues than ownership. Consequently, the CJEU dismissed the\naction for the annulment of the contested directive.396\nThe core objective of the Directive 2003/87/EC consists of fostering the reductions of\ngreenhouse gas emissions through a “ cost-effective and economically efficient manner ”, i.e.,\nan emission trading scheme (ETS). In principle, being a measure of general scope, one\nshould assume it corresponds primarily to the tenets of proportionality and equal treatment.\nOne should bear in mind that allowances are interchangeable. Notwithstanding, if a company\nor any other actor of commerce does not count on the possibility to intervene in that market\nof those authorisations to emit, it will have to cope with an immediate lack of financial\ninstruments to control its costs. Consequently, it will experience an economic disadvantage\nin front of its competitors, with the subsequent impact upon its property rights.\nUnder these circumstances, one may wonder why lawmakers decide to exclude someone\nfrom the overall normative if that exclusion harms its [property] rights. This question seems\nto be what the applicant posed. The response is not hard to suppose. It concerns\nenvironmental reasons, a very understandable aspect if one thinks about the claimant’s\nactivities and its high pollutant character: “steel production”. Accordingly, although it turns\nout undeniable the intrusion upon the ordinary exert of ownership, its social function and the\ngeneral interest determine the prevalence of environmental reasons in case of conflict.

Nevertheless, they are not the only ones concerning the interplay\nbetween property rights and environmental protection. There are two more cases, i.e., seven\nin total, which match to three preliminary rulings, one appeal, one failure of a member State\nto fulfil its obligations, and two requests for annulment. The main arguments related to\nviolations to property rights, employed in the last two adjudications, consisted of the\nrevocation of a permit authorising the construction and operation of a landfill site for\nwaste,401 and the disclosure of information.402 Once again, the Court of Justice and the\nGeneral Court decided both judgements against property rights, arguing its social function\nand the general interest, under similar terms than those quoted in this subsection.\nIt is worth elaborating a reflection at this point. The idea of exercising property rights,\nrestricted by its social function or the general interest, is not a rare provision in European\nnational legislations, or even around the globe. Both themes exist, sometimes with the same\nlabel and sometimes with different ones.\nIf one scrutinises, for example, the national legal frameworks alluded to in here, one can\nfigure out that all juridical systems include some explicit reference thereon. Thus, the\nGerman Constitution establishes that expropriations are permissible for the public good , and\ntheir compensations should correspond to the public interest . Likewise, the Constitution of\nLuxemburg lays down that property can be limited only for reasons of public utility . On its\npart, the Italian Constitution does expressly recognise the social function of property. Given\nthe United Kingdom does not possess a constitution in the strict sense, so to speak, but rather\nan “uncodified” one, the reference corresponds to the Law of Property Act. It declares that\nthe discharge or modification of a restriction to the reasonable use of land can base on public\ninterest.403\nCorrespondingly, similar allusions appear in other legislations. The Spanish\nConstitution, for instance, also mentions the social function and public utility of the property,",

On\ntheir part, the French Constitution incorporates the concept of public necessity, and the\nBelgium Constitution mentions the idea of public purpose.404\nAll these different labels comprise parallel concepts to the Court’s notions concerning\nthe social function of property and the general interest. For this reason, it turns out strange\nthat some national tribunals often disagree on this point with the CJEU, deciding in favour\nof property rights instead of environmental protection. Indeed, it sounds contradictory that\ngovernments and the very Court use both aspects, but especially general interest, once to\nprotect ownership and at other times to defend the environment.\nIn any case, the overwhelming result (100% of the cases) concerning the prevalence of\nenvironmental issues over property rights within the CJEU’s adjudications could lead\nwrongly to the perception that there exists a genuine concern for Nature in itself, within the\nambit of the Court. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind the conceptions of “social”\nfunction of property and “general interests” do not focus on Nature exclusively but rather on\nhuman beings. Consequently, if one scrutinises principal subject matters of all cases, one\ncan notice they do refer to environmental issues but related to people’s welfare, such as\npollution of water and soils, allowances for greenhouse gas emissions, or payments of crossundertakings.

Commission,\nall cases include mentions of health.\nAs mentioned in chapter three, one of the manifestations of the entitlement to “ dispose\nof” ownership was the notion of “trade” because it alluded to the transference of property\nrights from an individual to another. Hence, if one selects those judgements in which one\ncan find any reference to the expressions: “trade”, “market”, and “commerce”, along with\ntheir associated terminologies, it is possible to construct a respectable sample of 185 records.\nOn the other hand, the complete sample includes a variable related to the qualification\nof the Court’s decisions as eco-friendly or not. Evidently, one should warn the criteria to\nlabel a judgement as a favourable to Nature, or not, are mostly subjective, given they depend\non many factors associated with the eye of the beholder. One empirical example is the\nauthorisation to construct several kinds of public works (e.g., roads, dams, power lines,\namong other infrastructures). Some people surely deem the existence of an environmental\nimpact assessment warranties the eco-friendly character of the project, while others perhaps\nbelieve the mere construction of this sort of installations (despite counting on an accurate\necological analysis) are harmful to Nature. Thence, from this point on, the green character\nof any judicial resolution, in the assumption of a legal conflict, will rely on the observer’s\ncriteria. However, one should bear in mind that, by no means, the label of “non-eco-friendly”\nmust be understood as a contra legem decision (i.e., against the law ). All interpretations got\nformulated thereon under the assumption of full legality.\nNow, there is a special kind of CJEU’s decisions, in which it is feasible to minimise\nthat subjectivity, the declarations of failures by a member State to fulfil its obligations.\nEffectively, given they usually have to do with breaches of European normative, one could\ndetermine as a green variable the accomplishment of European regulations concerning the\nenvironment.\nIn any case, following the general terms of the methodology, chart # 15 reveals the\ncorrelation coefficient concerning the set of judgements combining both variables: “trade”\nand “eco-friendly decisions”. As mentioned, the central idea is to confirm the level of their\nassociation from an alternative standpoint, a statistical one in this case, given that the quoted\napplication of the social function of property and the principle of the general interest\nsomehow demonstrated the Courts tendency toward the human and environmental valuation\nof disputes.\nA priori, if one considers the entire sample of 185 records, the judgements would be\n75% eco-friendly (140) and 25% non-eco-friendly (45), approximatively. Moreover, the\nchronological bond of variables reaches a remarkably high level of correlation, quite close\nto 1 (r = 0.960), an aspect that definitively corroborates-in practice-the results of the legal\nanalysis unfolded at the beginning of this subsection. Indeed, as one can notice, it is very\nillustrative to see how both curves overlap each other in several segments.",

    "text": "In parenthesis, to avoid any methodological misunderstanding or arbitrariness\nconcerning the results of the coefficient, to the extent feasible, one must specify that the\nseries of data related to the environmentally friendly adjudications exclusively corresponds\nto the sample associated with the variable of “trade” (135 items), namely it does not refer to\nthe complete sequence of eco-friendly rulings (285 items). The reasoning to use the former\nlies in the very scope of research. The central idea consisted of outlining the ecological\nbehaviour of the Court respecting the judgements of “trade”; consequently, the use of cases\nwith other subject matters would have turned out nonsensical. Anyway, one should be\nconscious that it is inevitable the existence of some range of biased criteria whatever be the\nstatistical information one chooses.\nTherefore, for the purpose of maintaining the impartiality of upshots, it is worth pointing\nout the correlation coefficient between the concepts of “ trade” and “eco-friendly\njudgements ” (the complete sampling) also reached a high standard (r = 0.871). Certainly,\nthis outcome does not attain the levels of association shown in chart # 15; however, the\ninterplay between both variables continues to be remarkably close. It depicts a kind of\nconfirmation concerning the social and environmental tendencies of the Court.\nIn other words, the most paramount conclusion one can reach, from these results, has to\ndo with the level of conceptual consistency of the Court. In a certain way, the high ranges of\ncorrelation are not an isolated statistical effect, but rather they could get linked with the\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020Number of Cases\nTrade Eco-friendly rulings Lineal (Eco-friendly rulings)r = 0.960\nCJEU’s recurrent criteria concerning the prevalence of the social function of property and\ngeneral interest over ownership and other associated conceptualisations, such as the “trade”.\nNotwithstanding, if one disaggregates the database in the function of the judicial actions,\ninformation adopts a series of quite thought-provoking peculiarities. Thus, for example,\nrequests for annulments and preliminary rulings seem to be more balanced. Instead, the\ncategory of appeals experiences a more biased effect than the other groups and the complete\nset of data, let alone the declarations of failures to fulfil state obligations. As mentioned,\nthough, the presence of the high rate of eco-friendly adjudications within the last category\ncan get explained for the existence of numerous state breaches of European directives.

Nonetheless, its scope is\nquite different from the previous category. As mentioned, its overwhelming quantity of ecofriendly rulings (53 items) is due principally to the high level of legal breaches coming from\nEuropean countries. The most remarkable difference respecting preliminary rulings lies in\nthe fact that these declarations do not necessarily apply to specific cases in the State of origin.\nDepending on every situation, therefore, it could represent an environmental advantage if\nthe order from the Court refers to general measures of public policy. Otherwise, it would\nremain in the orbit of individual circumstances, with limited effects.\nLastly, both appeals (24 judgements) and requests for annulments (14 cases) depict a\nmarginal quantity in front of the total. However, the fact they somehow represent the Court’s\ncriteria underlies their importance, especially the former, due to its high rate.\nIn either event, one must recognise the European Court of Justice depicts better overall\nconditions to defence the environmental interests than national systems of justice. Still, the\nlack of a certain commitment concerning the protection of Nature in itself, beyond the human\nbenefits, leads to thinking about a subjacent but constant need for representation.\nTo conclude, there is jurisprudence endorsing the Court’s legal yardstick, which\nalthough does not correspond precisely to environmental issues but agricultural ones instead,\nalludes to and reinforces the notion of the right to property as one of the general principles\nof European law and its social function. The Court has utilised them as precedents of\ndifferent adjudications.407 In addition, albeit they do not have to do with environmental\nissues at all, there is another set of rulings also employed by the CJEU, as precedents for the\nvalid restrictions of property rights. They mainly refer to taxes, methods of production,\nfisheries, impounding of goods, copyright, destruction of stocks, trade, security policy, and\nso forth.408",

    "text": "As mentioned in the introductory section of this chapter, one of the research hypotheses had\nto do with the relationship between ownership, as a specific feature of litigants, and the\nachievement of a ruling favourable to environmental interests. Hence, the procedure of\nanalysis consisted of a perusal, case-by-case, of the whole sample, searching for\nrelationships of property between the parties and natural resources. In contrast to the initial\nassumptions, the number of owners who have been part of litigation, even within requests\nfor preliminary rulings (indeed those cases are the majority), is quite marginal, that is, only\n14.65% of the petitioners and defendants were owners.\nAnother preliminary presumption one would have to dismiss corresponds to the idea\nthat litigants were owners of natural resources. In practice, save specific cases in which the\nparties of the disputes were landowners, the relationships of property referred instead to\ndiverse economic interests, businesses, and other related commercial activities. Under this\nperspective, although it could sound meaningless, the shipload of boats prosecuted for\nfishing without a license in the early eighties could have been probably the closer examples\nto the ownership over natural resources. Therefore, when one speaks about property rights,\nwithin the ambit of the sample elaborated in the present research, it means a genuine\nconnection of ownership between one of the litigants, or parties in the main dispute, and\nlands, companies, shares, and other similar businesses.\nFurthermore, one should also consider the warning about the subjectivity of labelling a\njudgement as eco-friendly, under the same terms explained in the preceding subsection, i.e.,\nthe qualification depends on the perspective of the observer, without including contra legem\ndecisions. In this line of thought, one should also deem if owners, either applicants or\ndefendants, are trying to attain eco-friendly rulings as their goal or not. Indeed, most of the\ntime, holders of property rights do not mind for environmental aspects. They are merely\nattempting to protect their interests.\nAll these methodological restrictions lead to rethinking about the premises of the initial\nhypothesis. To meet that purpose, for the time being, the first step would be to stop thinking",

Notice one\ndoes not refer to specific resolutions biased towards ecological implications. It deals with a\nmuch simpler assumption, with far-reaching repercussions, i.e., property rights somehow\ninfluencing the result of a judicial proceeding.\nBefore presenting the graphic, one should warn that the case C-315/16 got excluded\nfrom the sample. For informative purposes, the judgement refers to a preliminary ruling for\nJózsef Lingurár v. Miniszterelnökséget vezető minister (2017) , requested by the Supreme\nCourt of Hungary ( Kúria). In the main dispute, the claimant demanded compensatory\nsupport for his forest plots, the principal object in conflict, predicated on the network Natura\n2000, which the Chancellery of the Prime Minister initially had refused.409\nThe core methodological issue consists of both litigants share the property of the forest\nlands. Consequently, the inclusion of this judgement into the database employed to draw the\nchart would bring about duplication of records, altering the results wrongly. In that regard,\nit would turn out preferable to reduce the sample in one solely item to obtain more adequate\nresults, than to maintain it entirely and acquire inexact outcomes. In any event, the exclusion\nof the adjudication is merely temporal and applicable only to this specific situation. It does\nnot mean a definitive elimination from the sample.\nIn addition, as one will notice in the next illustration, the information corresponding to\n“no-owners” experiences a “mirror effect”, owing to the fact that the data for applicants and\ndefendants is evidently the same. So, chart # 17 below shows the initial upshot.\nCuriously, as one can observe, the condition of the holder of property rights does not\nwarranty any success concerning the application or defence, as appropriate. Quite the\nopposite, the data evidence it is more probable that claimants, who dispose of the condition\nof owners, lose the disputes, or obtain unfavourable decisions. Indeed, in 52.94% of the\ncases, the plaintiffs-owners lost the judgements or received an adverse ruling. In any case,\nthe difference is not too significant (only two records) and could vary the forthcoming years.\nThe situation is entirely opposed when the applicants are not owners. They have obtained\nsuccessful results in more than 70% of the proceedings.",

In that regard, one should begin\nmentioning the more selfevident ones. Firstly, something one knows beforehand is that\nwhen the owner is the claimant, most decisions are environmentally friendly. It does not\nmean, nevertheless, the proprietor always obtains adjudications favourable to its interests.\nSo, if one takes a glance at hard data, one can figure out the proportion is virtually half-andhalf. A second visible aspect is that when the owners are the respondent, the adjudications\nare also ecologically benign but involving a radical difference: the rulings often includes\nadverse conditions to their interests most of the time. Moreover, the gap is much more\nextensive.\nNow, there is a set of attractive nuances that one cannot deduce directly from what the\nprevious charts show. So, for example, proprietors who bring lawsuits do not always search\nfor decisions in favour of Nature. Indeed, just a little more than half of the applicant-owners\nwere looking for green sentences (52.94%). By the way, this last percentage comes from the\naddition of eco-friendly rulings, either favourable or not so, in which the owners were\npetitioners. This affirmation also constitutes, however, a subjective argument because most\nof the time the environmental interests are only ancillary of the personal ones. If one\nscrutinises the database, one confirms those applicants are primarily individuals and private\ncompanies defending their lands or businesses. There are also one environmental\norganisation and one municipality, and that is it. Placing this reasoning in statistical terms,\none may assert that only half of the petitioners attempt to achieve an eco-friendly ruling\nbefore the CJEU. Still, from that segment, 67% of plaintiffs reach an environmentally\nsuccessful adjudication. It deals with relatively encouraging figures for Nature.\nWhen owners occupy the place of defendants, they hardly acquire favourable\nadjudications, let alone ecologically successful ones. Tellingly, although most rulings are\neco-friendly, they come mainly from adverse decisions to respondents, that is, 64.71% of the\njudgements are environmentally fruitful, but in more than 80% of those cases, the defendants\nlost the proceedings. Additionally, only 23.53% of defendant-owners were seeking green\nadjudications. Among them, one can identify individuals, a private company, and a local\ngovernment.\nSumming up, although one could relatively associate the condition of proprietor with\nenvironmentally friendly rulings, especially in the case of applicants, from the statistical\nperspective, it is not entirely clear if the original intention of the litigants gets oriented toward\nthe achievement of such an objective. Quite the opposite, the context of the disputes appears\nto demonstrate the ancillary character of the ecological interests respecting private ones.",

    "text": "The third judicial hypothesis of the present research aims at enquiring about if there is\nanybody capable to exercise any form of representation of Nature before international\ntribunals, through the application of the legal framework currently in force. To respond to\nthis query, the analysis of judgements concerning the assessments of the environmental\nimpacts (EIA) of projects was fairly valuable. Likewise, it is worth recalling that there was\nalready a subtle suggestion about the need to count on Nature’s representation at the\nbeginning of this section.\nThe execution of public and private projects is quite probably one of the best examples\nof the tensions between property rights and environmental protection. Equally, it is the\nperfect scenario where the need for someone who takes over ecological interests becomes\nvisible. Indeed, although the kernel of the judicial disputes does not always rest upon\nownership or representation, both aspects often lie behind the motivation of lawsuits\nconcerning revisions of permits and monitoring.\nTo illustrate this assertion, one can utilise the preliminary ruling petitioned by the\nAustrian Administrative Court ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) concerning the action brought by\nthe Municipality (Marktgemeinde) of Straßwalchen and other 59 claimants against the\nFederal Ministry for Economy, Family and Youth (Bundesminister für Wirtschaft,\nFamilie und Jugend) . The main proceeding referred to a decision authorising the company\nRohöl-Aufsuchungs AG to carry out exploratory drilling of natural gas up to a total quantity\nof one million cubic metres, without counting on an environmental impact assessment.\nAccording to the national tribunal, the company foresaw the extraction of 150 to 250\nthousand cubic metres of gas per day, on average. Moreover, the experimental production\nprincipally aimed at proving if it was economically viable,410 i.e., it concerned to a\ndichotomy between ownership and environmental protection.\nIn this regard, the central query of the referred tribunal before the CJEU bore upon the\npertinence of categorising the trial production of natural gas as an “ extraction for commercial\npurposes”.411 In a certain way, the question was kind of suggestive; one could even say\nunnecessary. The reason was that Directive concerning Environmental Impact Assessment\n[EIA Directive, currently repealed] provided that this type of extractions had to count on an\nenvironmental impact assessment, so long as the extracted amount exceeds 500 thousand\ncubic meters per day.412 As the very Court observed, however, the application of the\nstandards established in the EIA Directive did not make sense, because the limit authorised\nto Rohöl-Aufsuchungs AG was unrelated to the Directive’s threshold.413\nIn the end, the CJEU rejected the arguments formulated by the claimants, considering\nthat drilling intended for establishing the cost-effectiveness of a natural source did not come\nwithin the scope of the invoked provisions. Nevertheless, it also ruled about the obligation\nof counting on an environmental assessment, alluding to a different article within the same\nDirective. The Court demanded that elaboration of the EIA, deeming the depth of the drilling\noperation (4,150 metres), instead of the quantity of production.414\nTo sum up, it seems clear this decision denotes the prevalence of environmental issues\nover property rights before the Court. Nonetheless, it also allows noticing that national public\nauthorities and private entities align themselves with the notion of economic interests, even\ndefending the scope of those arguments conceptually. Under these circumstances, at least\nduring the administrative procedure, it turns out quite curious that, except for the",

At present, Directives 85/337/EEC and 97/11/EC are thoroughly abrogated, likewise Article\n31 of the Directive 2009/31/EC, which had modified the aforesaid point # 14 of Annex I. The rest of the\nDirective 2009/31/EC is in force. In addition, Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain\npublic and private projects on the environment constitutes the legal framework in force, which repealed and\nreplaced all quoted directives. Within this legal text, the normative reference of the case is still point # 14 of\nAnnex I. See Directive 2011/92/EU (2012), Annex V, Part A.\n413 Case C-531/13, Marktgemeinde Straßwalchen and others (2015) para. 24th.\n414 ibid Resolution; Council Directive 85/337/EEC (1985) [repealed], Article 4 (2) and Annex II, point # 2(d).\nMunicipality (claimant accompanied by a group of potentially affected people), no public\nauthority nobody seems to take over ecological interests. For this reason, one can argue the\nCJEU played a critical role in terms of representation, within this proceeding, by deciding\nagainst the original criteria coming from the Austrian Ministry that authorised the project\nwithout environmental warranties.\nAnother example concerning the building of projects, in which the Court neither aligned\nwith the Member State’s opinion, can be found in Commission v. Spain (2004) . In its\njudgement, the CJEU decided against the Spanish government due to the lack of “[...] an\nassessment of the effects on the environment of the project for a Valencia-Tarragona railway\nline, Las Palmas-Oropesa section. Roadbed ”. As the chief argument of exculpation, the\ndefendant affirmed that the environmental impact assessment was not necessary for those\nworks implying an enhancement of existing infrastructure, that is, the installation of a single\ntrack did not constitute the construction of a new railway line.415\nBeyond the environmentally friendly character of this ruling, what one should\nemphasise is the fact that the intervention of a supranational entity is sometimes required in\norder to avoid certain overindulgence in the application of national, and sometimes even\ninternational, legislation. In other words, it is crucial to count on an actor endowed with\nenough [political/legal?] power to influence local public decisions. From a brief analysis of\nthe Spanish government’s discourse, one can infer a marked bias in favour of the execution\nof public works. Interestingly, lexical uses are evidence. They characterise the recurrent\nemployment of expressions such as “not necessary”, “not required”, “not applicable”, “not\nintended”, “not apply”, or “not subjecting to”.416\nTo continue, the already quoted proceeding of Jozef Križan and others v. the Slovak\nEnvironment Inspection [Slovenská Inšpekcia Životného Prostredia] (2013) constitutes\nother attractive judgement to analyse relating to the strains between property rights and\nenvironmental protection. Furthermore, it includes a couple of elements of dispute, public\nparticipation- understood under the terms of the Aarhus Convention- and the incomplete or\nincorrect development of processes to evaluate environmental impacts. The case has had\nsuch a level of repercussions among the environmentalists, to the point it got included in the",

Kingdom of Spain (2004) Resolution, para.\n37th.\n416 ibid paras. 17th, 36th, 37th, 39th, 41st, 44th, and 45th.\nGlobal Atlas of Environmental Justice, an online platform aimed at documenting and\ncataloguing social conflicts regarding environmental issues.417\nBy and large, the judgement referred to a request for a preliminary ruling, asked by the\nSupreme Court of the Slovak Republic ( Najvyšší súd Slovenskej Republiky ), regarding the\nissuing of an authorisation to construct and operate a landfill site in a former quarry, located\nin Pezinok. Jozef Križan, along with other 43 residents, filed a lawsuit questioning the\nlawfulness of the permit, granted by the Environment Inspection in favour of the company\nEkologická Skládka. The claimants principally invoked a breach of the Slovak law, by which\nthe application coming from the waste company was incomplete as far as it did not include\nthe urban planning decision on the location of the landfill site. Furthermore, they also argued\nthe defendant has denied publishing the mentioned decision, based on its commercially\nconfidential character.418\nAs one can read in the judgement, the proceedings underwent two phases. Firstly, during\nthe administrative stage, the company lodged the waste permit before the Environment\nInspection Authority of Bratislava ( Inšpektorát Životného Prostredia Bratislava ) in\nSeptember 2007. In November, given the alluded lack of the urban planning decision, that\nlocal authority requested the company the submission of such a document. In December,\nEkologická Skládka presented it but warning its commercially confidential character. So, the\ncompany did not publish it, according to the parameters of the Aarhus Convention. On its\npart, the authority neither conveyed that urban planning resolution to the plaintiffs. Lastly,\nin January 2008, the Authority of Bratislava conferred the company the authorisation.\nDisagreeing, the claimants appealed that authorisation before the second instance body, i.e.,\nthe Slovak Environment Inspection, who published the urban planning decision between\nMarch and April 2008 but dismissed the appeal as unfounded in August.419\nSecondly, as part of the judicial stage, the plaintiffs brought a lawsuit against the\nmentioned dismissal before the Bratislava Regional Court ( Krajský súd ), which dismissed\ntheir action in December 2008. The petitioners appealed before the Supreme Court of\nSlovakia afterwards, whose result was favourable to them for the first time during the whole\nprocedure. Effectively, this tribunal suspended and annulled the integrated permit in May\n2009, predicated mainly on the fact that both administrative authorities “[...] had failed to\nobserve the rules governing the participation of the public concerned in the integrated",

Among other reasons, the Constitutional Court overruled the\nappealed decision arguing the infringement of the company’s right to peaceful enjoyment\nof its property , recognised by both the Slovakian Constitution and the Additional Protocol\nto the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, it determined that the Supreme\nCourt had exceeded its powers by examining the legal principles of the environmental impact\nassessment, “[...] even though the appellants had not disputed them and it lacked\njurisdiction to rule on them ”. Ultimately, the Constitutional Court referred the case back to\nthe Supreme Court so that it can give a fresh ruling.421\nUnder those circumstances, the Supreme Court decided to stay the proceedings and\nrequest the preliminary ruling, in which solely one of the five questions posed to the CJEU\nhad to do strictly with property rights.

In context, beyond the\nfavourable or disadvantageous nature of the administrative and judicial results, obtained by\nMr Križan and the other plaintiffs, one can corroborate that both the Slovakian authorities\nand the legal system represented a warranty of the Aarhus Convention’s provisions in this\nfield. Indeed, they imply by no means a hindrance to the exercise of property rights. This\nwas precisely the opinion of the CJEU to reply to the fifth question, i.e., the implementation\nof the international law was “[...] not capable, in itself, of constituting an unjustified\ninterference with the developer’s right to property [...]”.423\nSecondly, within the text of the adjudication, there is an allusion to the [currently\nabrogated] Directive 96/61 with respect to the integrated pollution prevention and control,\nwhich contained a very similar provision to that one already cited as part of the Aarhus\nConvention. It establishes the same procedural guarantees of access to decisions, acts, or\nomissions concerning public participation so that both analyses turn out notoriously\ninterconnected. Finally, one last reference corresponded to the EIA Directive regarding the\nnecessary environmental assessment of the effects of the projects. This aspect neither alters\nthe exercise of property rights in any shape or form.424\nIn either event, beyond the appropriate or inappropriate legal implications over public\nparticipation in projects, the lack of a national tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide about\nenvironmental questions unfailingly leads to an absence of representation relating to\necological interests or, at least, the welfare of those people to whom the project could",

However, the extract quoted in the adjudication was\nnot really incorporated by the alluded Regulation 166/2006/EC. Indeed, the correct reference about the\ninsertion of Article 15a is located in the set of amendments to the Directive 96/61/EC, issued in the Article\n4(4) of the Directive 2003/35/EC providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans\nand programmes relating to the environment (2003), which is currently in force as well. Some years later, the\nCouncil Directive 96/61/EC was repealed by the Directive 2008/1/EC concerning integrated pollution\nprevention and control (2008), in which the provision at issue was codified in Article 16. Finally, this Directive\n2008/1/EC was also repealed by the Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n24 November 2010 on industrial emissions [integrated pollution prevention and control] (2008), which is\ncurrently in force and whose respective provision is located in Article 2; Council Directive 85/337/EEC (1985)\nArticle 2 (1 and 2), currently repealed.\npotentially affect. Within the administrative phases, something similar occurs with decisionmakers.\nWithout appearing too much exaggerated, the fact that a private company, such as\nEkologická Skládka , had set conditions on information, illustrate quite clearly how a private\ninterest could unfairly restrict the exercise of people’s rights, let alone Nature’s ones.\nEffectively, when the company submitted the missing document about the project’s location,\nit did it under the prevention to be revealed, due to reasons of commercial confidentiality. In\nthis regard, the CJEU has been strict in rejecting the use of trade secrets as a justification of\nany breach of the Aarhus Convention or the European law, even throughout different\ninstitutional reports.425\nBy way of conclusion, although the CJEU denied the arguments about the impairment\nof property rights, upheld by both the enterprise and the Constitutional Court, one should\nnot completely ignore the fact that the representation of environmental interests, and even\npeople’s, are often ineffective at a national level. Therefore, the intervention of the CJEU\nturns out once again crucial to represent Nature, either invoking the general interest and the\nsocial function of property or prioritising the people’s rights to participate in the public\ndecision-making processes. Both aspects contribute to the protection of Nature over private\ninterests.426\nAnother manner of exercising the representation occurs through the intervention of\nprivate entities. One can find an example in TestBioTech eV and others v. Commission\nwhich the European Commission authorised to Monsanto Europe SA the “[...] placing on\nthe market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from the genetically modified\nsoybean [...]”, following the guidelines of the Regulation 1829/2003/EC.427\nWithin the administrative procedure, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found\n“[...] the modified soybean was, in the context of its intended uses, as safe as its nongenetically modified comparator with respect to potential effects on human or animal health\nor on the environment. ” The European Commission employed this assertion as a foundation",

On their part, the\napplicants claimed that this evaluation “[...] was flawed, that the synergistic or\ncombinatorial effects had not been taken into consideration, that the immunological risks\nhad not been adequately assessed and that no monitoring of the effects on health had been\nrequired.”428\nDuring the judicial stage, the General Court ultimately dismissed the action, arguing the\nplaintiffs could not explain the “[...] significant differences identified between the modified\nsoybean and its conventional counterpart [...]”, among other reasons. Despite the fact that\nthe decision seemed to be unfavourable to environmental interests, at least indirectly, it\nyielded suggestive opinions on the contrary. Vesco Paskalev, for example, provocatively\nentitled his article: Losing the Battle, but Winning the War? He asserted that access to justice\nwidened in terms of admissibility of actions towards non-governmental organisations, which\nmeant an outstanding opportunity for promoting the representation of environmental\ninterests, from the private sector. Furthermore, it was also good news the Commission not\nbe necessarily obliged to authorise processes involving GMO, Paskalev himself pointed out,\nwhich have been scientifically approved by the EFSA. It would allow the Commission\nfocusses more seriously on its responsibility of “[...] determining the appropriate level of\nprotection for society ” and, accordingly, also a level of protection for the ecosystem. There\nis another allusion concerning this aspect in the case of Dow AgroSciences Ltd. and others\nv. Commission (2011) as well.429\nIt is worth clarifying that the compulsory character of the EFSA’s opinion, in\ncompliance with the General Court’s reasoning, relies on specific provisions of Regulations\n1829/2003/EC and 178/2002, namely if the Commission adopts its decision according to\nArticles 7 and 19 of Regulation 1829/2003/EC, it is compelled to consider the EFSA’s view.\nAt the same time, if it issues an authorisation grounded on Articles 4 and 16 of Regulation\n178/2002, it is not bound. The difference between both sets of provisions rests upon the\nregulation’s literal sense. The former explicitly reads “ taking into account the opinion of the\nAuthority ”, while the latter does not include any express reference thereof.430",

It is not good news,\nenvironmentally speaking, because it means more ecological breakdowns over the\nforthcoming years. Indeed, the increase in projects and works without EIA during the last\nfive years has already been significant. In 2019, for example, that rate reached half of the\nrecords, while in 2016 and 2018 the absence of EIA was higher (56%). A final curious\nremark consists of the first environmental failure dates barely from 1994.\nUnlike the case of eco-friendly rulings in trade, the results set out in this subsection are\nnot subjective. The lack of EIA, its incorrect elaboration, or the overlooked requirements of\nthe EIA Directive constitute textual references into the judgements, that is, there is evidence\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020Number of Cases\nTotal EIA Without EIA Lineal (Without EIA)r = 0.939\nof how litigants or authorities failed to fulfil those green obligations. As one will see in the\nbar chart # 21, the global rate of projects without EIA seems to be quite high (38.30%).\nSomeone could question, however the qualification of the severity of results, arguing\nthat 38.3% is still far enough from the middle. In the end, one always could assert that\nqualitative reasoning depends on the eye of the beholder. In response, one should ponder\nthat if national authorities granted permits to four out of ten public or private projects or\nworks without an adequate EIA, their valuation of environmental issues differs substantially\nfrom the perspective of the Court. Moreover, it means that those governmental entities\napproving human interventions without EIA do not represent ecological interests at all at the\nlocal level.",

As one can notice in the bar chart below, the larger\ngroup corresponds to preliminary rulings with 67 records of 141 (47.52%). These decisions\nprecisely represent the highest levels of breaching the European law in this subject matter.\nIn fact, they are the only class of judgements in which the issuing of authorisations or permits\nto construct and operate projects or works without complying previously with environmental\nrequisites constitute the most of the cases (52.24%) over the whole period. The upshot is\nparticularly suggestive in this case because, as mentioned earlier, preliminary rulings are\nqueries posed by national authorities before the issuing of a decision. Consequently, it\nillustrates the absence of public or private entities that can depict the interests or Nature at\nthe local administrative level.\n0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%\nWith EIA72%\n28%87%\n13%100%48%\n52%\nOn the other hand, although the figures derived from the other judgements are not so\nmuch impressive as the previous ones, it is worth mentioning them, at least, as additional\nreferences. Thus, the second category in terms of percentage-almost so relevant as the\npreliminary rulings-was the declarations of failures to fulfil state obligations, with 65\nrecords (46.09%). In this series of data, one can find 18 incongruities concerning the\nenvironmental impact assessment (i.e., in 28% of the cases). This category is admittedly high\n(3 out of 10 involving any kind of legal error). Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind the\ndependence on the eye of the observer.\nUltimately, the other two categories are merely marginal so that it is enough to say both\nonly depict 6.38% of the sample and register solely one authorisation without a prior EIA\nout of nine in total.\nNow, considering the importance of preliminary rulings and declarations of failures to\nfulfil state obligations, it is worth displaying their individualised results in the function of\nthe three categories described above of mismatches, (1) lack of EIA, (2) incomplete EIA,\nand (3) non-observance of EIA Directive.\nAs one can observe in the following chart # 22, the bulk of legal errors in the process of\nenvironmental impact assessment correspond to lack of EIA before the issuing of\nauthorisations (25 records of a total of 35). It does not mean necessarily, however, negligence\nor non-observance of national and European law. When one reads the texts of the\nadjudications, it is not hard to find some answers, which usually are very simple but, in turn,\npersuasive.\nSo, the whole 25 judgements mentioned above involve the legal systems of Austria,\nBelgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom.\nCoincidentally, save Lithuania, all those countries have faced more than one lawsuit, coming\nfrom the Commission, for having failed to fulfil obligations of transposition from European\nlaw to their respective national legal systems. Of course, that transposition is related to\nenvironmental impact assessments. Moreover, one can notice that all those countries have\nlost at least one proceeding thereon. In consequence, there is evidence that European law has\nnot always applied in this subject matter at the national level, having not been transposed in\ntime. And, on the other hand, it follows that the execution of EIA previously to the issuing\nof authorisations to construct or operate projects or works was not always a lawful requisite\naccording to national laws. One can also corroborate this assertion by consulting the\njudgements. Therefore, under this logic, the fact that local authorities and judges have not\ndemanded the accomplishment of this step seems to be understandable, although maybe not\nentirely justifiable.",

It often seems there\nis somehow a systematic public policy biased to prevent the elaboration of EIA. As a\nconsequence, one can perceive in the national ambit more strongly the lack of someone who\nrepresents the interests of Nature. Therefrom, the CJEU, as the archetype of an international\ntribunal, plays a transcendental role to balance the unfair inclination of institutional\norganisations at the state level.\nSomething similar occurs with the declarations of failures to fulfil the obligations by\nStates. As mentioned, they depict the second group of importance (46.09%) within the series\nof data concerning the inadequate executions of environmental impact assessments. Unlike\nthe preliminary ruling, its actual rate of missing green requirements (27.69%) is not so high\nas the previous one. Nevertheless, its upshot could be a much more severe determinant. The\nreason lies in the preceding explanation about the lack of transposition of European law to\nnational legal systems. In this case, 11 out of 18 total judgements with observations about\nlack of or incorrect EIA involve issues about legal transpositions, i.e., 61.11%. Moreover,\none should keep in mind this category does not necessarily apply to a specific case-it often\n72%Incomplete EIA\n11%Wrong application\n17%\ndoes but not always-but rather it concerns nationwide.

This kind of “green label” possesses the peculiarity\nof being “subjective”, given that it relies on the eye of the observer. In parenthesis, once\nagain, this assertion must not be understood as the issuing of contra legem decisions (i.e.,\nagainst the law). One should often answer the question: what aspects should one consider\nfor determining if adjudication is eco-friendly or not? For example, some radical ecologists\ncould deem the authorisation to construct public works, counting on previous environmental\nimpact assessments, on special protection areas (SPA) is not definitively an eco-friendly\ndecision. Instead, for some other less radical people, the mere existence of an EIA could\nenough prove genuine environmental concern.\nIn this regard, nevertheless, the declarations of failures to fulfil state obligations\nminimise that subjectivity, because the Court - within their reasonings - precisely points out\nthe laws or rules were breached. Consequently, one could specify that any ruling that hands\nout punishments for disobedience of environmental law could be labelled as an eco-friendly\ndecision.

As European Union’s\ninstitution, it counts on legitimacy and independence that the Member States recognise.\nNevertheless, one should keep in mind that this assumption works out almost exclusively\nwith the declarations of failures, which do not constitute the vast majority of judgements.\nWhen one analyses the other judicial actions, one can see that neither the Commission nor\nthe other European institutions necessarily intervene in the proceedings.\nIn tandem with the last assertion, although one has mentioned that the role of the CJEU\nhas been crucial to depict environmental interests on certain occasions, it is not a true\nrepresentative.

Later, in 2009, both\nregulations were abrogated by the Directive 2009/147/EC, which is the current normative in force concerning\nthe conservation of wild birds. See Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (1979)\n[repealed] Articles 3 and 4; Commission Directive 97/49/EC (1997) [repealed] Article 1; Directive\n2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the conservation of wild birds (2010) Article\n18 and Annex VI, Part A.\n433 Case C-355/90 ibid paras. 17th (emphasis added), 25th, 43rd, and 45th.\n434 ibid para. 18th; Case C-57/89, Commission of the European Communities v.

However, they do not form part of the present sampling, save the Case C-247/85.\nderogations (i.e., exceptions) to modify, reduce or even eliminate the extent of those\nterritories from the classification. “ If that were not so , [the CJEU has declared] the Member\nStates could unilaterally escape from the obligations imposed on them by Article 4(4) of the\ndirective with regard to special protection areas ”. The argument sounds somehow\ncontradictory. To Krämer, Member States had the duty to designate special protection areas,\naccording to the “[...] clear and unambiguous wording of Article 4(1) ” of the Birds\nDirective. On their part, Jans and Vedder, who share Krämer’s opinion, have added the\nargument about the lack of an express foundation allowing exceptions within the\nDirective.435\nIn either event, the Spanish reasoning illustrates quite well, not only the supremacy of\nproperty rights over environmental protection within its legal discourse but also the lack of\nan institutional stance in favour of nature conservation at the national level. The country has\nother concerns; it is worrying about the production of fish, the size of industries, among other\neconomic interests. On its part, the Commission is who paradoxically emphasises the\necological value of Santoña marshes and its wetlands for endangered species of birds.\nConsequently, one can assert the country-applicant does not represent or defend any green\nright or interest, at least, in the present case.436\nOn the other hand, the alluded absence to environmental representation is more\nnoticeable when the Court’s rulings are in contradistinction to the Commission’s opinion. In\nthese proceedings, the Commission’s endeavours to support eco-friendly postures do not\nseem to be sufficient. Thus, in Commission v. France (1999) , the CJEU dismissed an\nallegation of ecological failure by France for having declassified a part of the SPA, known\nas Marais Poitevin intérieur , a zone of marshland located in the Western of the country.437\nThe applicant argued that France had reduced the surface of the special protection area\nin order to construct the motorway link between the communities of Sainte-Hermine and\nOulmes. This project had been declared of public utility and urgent and had accomplished\nthe requirements of compatibility with the land use, public enquiries, and the environmental\nimpact assessment, according to the [currently repealed] Council Directive 85/337/EEC\nconcerning precisely the latter.438",

That area simply did not integrate the SPA.440\nNevertheless, it draws attention to why the Court did not even spare a glance at the\nCommission’s argument about the environmental effects of the motorway construction.\nThere is only a brief mention about the disturbance of birds by virtue of the completion of\nworks and, even more important, “[...] the isolation of the remainder of the SPA east of the\nproject towards Fontenay-le-Comte, which will be cut off entirely from the SPA by the\nmotorway ”.441 In consequence, if the country of origin is not in the line of the ecological\nprotection, and the Commission’s reasoning is not enough to legally influence the Court’s\ndecision, Nature is thoroughly helpless.\nFurthermore, drawing an analogy with property rights, although it did not deal with a\nprivate project, one could affirm there is also a tension against environmental protection\nwhen public interests are involved. Thus, as one can notice in this case, States sometimes\nimpose their developmental agenda over the ecological one.",

Thus, the Court\nruled for the sake of humans, arguing that “[...] the system laid down in Article 5 reflects\nrequirements relating to the protection of public health, and thus pursues an objective of\ngeneral interest without the substance of the right to property being impaired ”.443\nIn principle, albeit one is able to affirm the adjudication settles the dispute through a\npersuasive anthropocentric discourse concerning public health, it turns out irrefutable that\nthe effects derived from the resolution are eco-friendly to the detriment of property rights in\npractice. Someone could consider it an a priori conclusion if it were not for the existence of\nparallel opinions about the same case.

He accounts for the existence of judicial precedents, in\nwhich the CJEU has expressly recognised the environmental protection as a question of the\ngeneral interest of the Union. To support his comment, the author even employs a couple of\njudgements ( Procureur v. ADBHU and Commission v.

Furthermore,\nthere are other similar precedents also quoted by the Court.446\nUnlike the previous judgement, in the already quoted case TestBioTech and others v.\nCommission (2016) , the assertions concerning health as foundations for the legal action\ninstead of environment ones did not sound weird. Recapitulating, the petitioners questioned\nthe granting of a market authorisation to Monsanto Europe for its genetically modified\nsoybean. As the United Kingdom argued thereon, the company did not ask permission to\ncultivate the modified soybean in Europe, so that “[...] the environmental risk assessment\n[was] therefore limited to a consideration of the likely effects of accidental dissemination\ninto the environment ”. In parenthesis, both the U.K. and Monsanto participated in support\nof the Commission’s stance.447\nIn other words, ecological reasons to claim in this case are merely ancillary with respect\nto the question of health. Potential effects against human welfare are the gist of the argument.\nAlthough this idea somehow distorts the scope of the healthy environment as a concept, one\ncannot deny it seems to be a recurrent manner to invoke it by and before the Court. Indeed,\nit reappears occasionally in the official discourse of the Commission, such as it happens\napropos of a parallel case between the same litigants, but which the Court settled two years\nafterwards. Thus, within TestBioTech eV v. European Commission (2018) , the parties put\non the table their pro and against arguments to address the dimensions of human health and\nenvironmental protection separately, within the framework of the market authorisations for\ngenetically modified organisms. In that regard, the Commission adopted its past position\nabout the accidental damage, whose repercussions could place health, more than the\nenvironment, in jeopardy. Finally, unlike the previous decision, this time the General Court\nruled the annulment of the challenged letter, recognising “[...] it is clear that the scope of\nthe concept of ‘environmental law’ is not as restricted as claimed by Commission in the\ncontested decision ”, a very well welcome statement by the activism.448\nSumming up, it is possible to identify specific jurisprudence in which the litigants\nadduce the notion of human health as a foundation to defence environmental issues, i.e., as",

    "text": "The common thread of this chapter turned especially around the tensions between property\nrights and environmental protection, in the framework of the CJEU’s adjudications. In this\nregard, four research questions were guiding the whole academic discourse, which are the\nsame four queries that will be framing the presentation of the conclusions and findings.\nThus, the first hypothesis aimed at enquiring if international courts of justice were\nsettling the environmental disputes in favour of property rights and individual interests to\nthe detriment of Nature . From the CJEU’s standpoint, at least, one should recognise there\nis no evidence concerning the Court’s likely biased trend to issue rulings favourable to\nproperty rights. On the contrary, in the totality of the proceedings in which there was any\nstrain between ownership and environmental protection, the Court auspiciously ruled on the\nlatter, arguing the social function of property and reasons of general interests.\n0.00.10.10.20.20.30.30.40.4\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020Number of Cases\nTotal Property Trade Eco-friendly rulings Health\nLikewise, the statistical data concerning those judgements involving aspects associated\nwith market showed a clear tendency, maybe even overwhelming, towards the emission of\neco-friendly rulings (75%). As mentioned, however, this percentage is subjective, given the\nqualification of the category “eco-friendly” relies on the observer, without including contra\nlegem decisions (i.e., against the law).\nIn any case, the precedent information constitutes an indicator that statistically\ncontradicts the initial assumption, according to which the Court issued rulings promoting a\nsort of partiality for property rights. In plain language, the theoretical and legal\npredominance of property rights over natural resources, alleged by defenders and promoters\nof rights of Nature appears to be more rhetorical than empirically verifiable in the\ninternational field.\nSecondly, the research also aimed at determining if it was necessary to be the owner of\nnatural resources or exercise any kind of associated rights for obtaining eco-friendly\nrulings. Even though the response, statistically speaking, could be emphatically negative,\none should deem several nuances thereon. From the outset, one should remark that litigants\nare not often owners of natural resources, save certain cases concerning lands. They exercise\nproperty rights associated with diverse economic interests, businesses, and other commercial\nactivities. Even in those cases, nevertheless, their judicial participation is marginal (14.65%)\nin front of the total.\nBy and large, being a proprietary does not warranty a successful result before the Court.\nQuite the opposite, the data have proved that the petitioners-owners obtained an\nunfavourable decision in almost 53% of the cases. The performance of the defendantsowners was even less fruitful by getting a disadvantageous judgement in nearly 65% of the\ncases.\nFrom the previous assertions on, one could conclude that it is not a requirement to be\nthe owner for obtaining a favourable eco-friendly ruling, mainly predicated on the marginal\ncharacter of data. Notwithstanding, one cannot also assure that all proprietors are searching\nfor a green judgement, as it were. Thus, presupposing the subjectivity of the information, as\nalluded to in the body of the chapter, one can deduce that only 52.94% of the claimantsowners looked for eco-friendly decisions. Furthermore, the scrutiny of the sample showed\nthat, even in those cases in which claimants were looking for green sentences, environmental\nmotives were ancillary of property rights. Those petitioners were primarily individuals and\nprivate companies defending their lands or businesses.\nThe third hypothesis referred to the existence of someone who could represent\nNature’s interests before international courts . The central premise denoted the application\nof the legal framework currently in force. Interestingly, within the answer to this research\nquestion, the surprisingly high significance of the dissatisfactions by States plays a crucial\nrole. Effectively, the redundant lack of environmental impact assessments at the national\nlevel and failures to accomplish green obligations constitute two clear indicators of the need\nto count on someone who can represent the environmental rights in the international arena.\nIn this framework, the heterogeneity of positions coming from States concerning the\ndisjunctive between environmental protection and property rights has undeniable\nrepercussions. In effect, while some national public entities firmly champion ecological\nprotection over economic interests, others defend the opposite openly under the umbrella of\nthe “public” or “general” interest as well. Moreover, while some States show divergences\nbetween their institutions of government and their entities in charge of the administration of\njustice, others even display aligned stances in defence of property rights instead. Under these\ncircumstances, the manner of coping with the environmental crisis at the international level\ncannot be uniform and organised. Consequently, a representative of green interests could be\nuseful to promote a more organic defence of natural resources at a global level.\nIn this regard, the European Commission arose as an attractive option, given its\nimpressive judicial results. The entity reached a rate of almost 81% of favourable rulings\nbetween 1979 and 2019. The vast majority of proceedings corresponded to declarations of\nfailures to fulfil state obligations, among which the proportion of eco-friendly decisions\nencompassed an overwhelming success rate of nearly 90%.\nConsequently, it turns out unavoidable to think about the Commission, or any other\nsimilar international entity (even the very European Union), as a genuine possibility to\nexercise the representation of environmental interests. Nevertheless, one should bear in mind\nthat those results are limited in terms of litigants and types of judicial actions. In other words,\nthe Commission virtually intervened before the Court only as petitioner or respondent in\nthose proceedings involving countries. When the participants are others (e.g., companies,\nNGOs, or even individuals), the intervention of the Commission is entirely marginal. This\nreason also applies to different kinds of actions. Its high rate of favourable judgements refers\nalmost exclusively to the declarations of failure to fulfil obligations. So, its participation in\nother disputes is merely peripheral. Therefore, although the Commission’s role as a\nrepresentative of green business could be a possibility, it still stands in the field of\nspeculation.\nMoreover, one should emphasise the momentous contribution of the Court’s rulings. In\neffect, there was a high percentage of opinions coming from different governments that the\nCourt contradicted or modified, and a set of breaches of law that the CJEU observed and\npunished. In consequence, its judgements could wrongly lead to think about it is not\nnecessary to count on a representative of environmental interests because its intervention is\nenough. Nevertheless, once again, one must consider the ambit of action coming from the\nCourt is restricted to its part as the organism to administrate justice. It directly depends on\nthe initiative of litigants, either States, or companies, or even individuals. The court,\ntherefore, could not be a kind of guardian of Nature at all or constitute even the protection\nwarranty. Its action should encircle in impartiality, fairness, and equity, among other\ncharacteristics.\nOne should formulate a twofold remark concerning the Court’s part played in the\nenvironmental question. So, one has first to admit that the root of the balance between the\nindependence and influential power of the CJEU lies chiefly in its regional character.\nFurthermore, one should mention the legitimacy it possesses in front of the Member States.\nThose particular circumstances endow the Court a peripheral vision about ecological issues\nthat adapts in a better fashion to the comprehensive character of Nature and facilitates it\nmore appropriate enforcement of community and international law.\nOn the other hand, one also has to acknowledge there is a second side of the same coin,\nwhich occurs when nobody chooses to bring a lawsuit before the Court. Under these\ncircumstances, its mechanisms merely would not have to work out. Therefore, it would be\ncrucial to count on a specific instance in charge of taking care of natural resources, without\ndepending on other’s goodwill.\nIn a certain sense, the response to the fourth question research could pose as a\nconsequence of the previous ones. It referred to the existence of sufficient guarantees to\nprotect natural resources in the current international system of justice . In that regard, one\ncan corroborate the presence of various elements that favour the protection of Nature and\nother ecosystems. For example, there is no prevalence of property rights over environmental\nprotection within the CJUE’s rulings. Additionally, the quality of the litigants (as proprietors\nor not) is not determinant to obtain a favourable decision. Likewise, there are entities capable\nof representing Nature’s interests before the Court, such as the Commission. And, finally,\nthe Court certainly provides a balance to the strains between property rights and\nenvironmental protection through its adjudications.\nOne could affirm that all these elements describe a favourable milieu to warranty the\nprotection of natural resources. Nonetheless, one also has to warn they have restrictions and\ndo not correctly operate all occasions. If one considers this argument, joint with the failures\nof the legal system (explained in the previous chapters), the conclusion could not be\nemphatical. In other words, there are legal and judicial warranties to protect Nature, but they\ndo not always reach their objectives thereon.\nBeyond those four conclusions, there are still a couple of significant findings to observe.\nThe first of them comprise the question concerning the right to a healthy environment. As\nmentioned, the Court reiteratively employs it as an argument even to justify measures\noriented to protect Nature. Although the concept, as it stands, does not appear regularly\nwithin the Court’s adjudications, it turns out clear-cut that the emphasis on health constitutes\nan effective alternative to promote the settlement of environmental issues. In any case, as\nalso alluded, its judicial and legal analysis implies a new dedication, maybe through another\ndissertation or research.\nFinally, one should argue the increasing trend of the environmental cases before the\nCourt between 1979 and 2019 is not in isolation. The totality of variables analysed in this\nchapter, i.e., property, trade, eco-friendly rulings, and health are consistent in terms of\ngrowth. This assertion got confirmed through the association between the Pearson’s\ncorrelation coefficient and the growth rates. Furthermore, one could see the cumulative\ndynamics of records is decelerating over time, according to parallel percentages. In that\nregard, it would be interesting to consider the effects of the adaptation to climate change in\nthe tendency of the lines. The influence of resilience in the increase of litigation could even\nbe a matter of future research.",

Indeed, they have recurrently\nbeen emphasising the widely spread assumption that the current environmental crisis is, in a\ncertain way, the result of the anthropocentric management of natural resources.450\nIn this line of thought, Laitos, Okulski, and Wolongevicz ascribe a large part of the\necological disaster to the anthropocentric character of current laws and policies, whose main\ngoal is to satisfy the human welfare exclusively. It accentuates the people’s wellbeing\nsuperiority over Nature’s and hence marks boundaries to their integral interdependence\n(fragmentation). Indeed, as Tóth points out, the fragmented and deficient character of some\ninternational standards is rarely useful to protect even people from ecological threats, for\nexample, such as the displacement due to climate change and environmental degradation.451\nMore specifically, within the field of Ethics, the insight is not too different. According\nto Taylor, for example, the vast bulk of ethicists deems that human-centred ethics is the “[...]\nmotivating cause for behaviour that plunders the Earth’s resources to meet the short-term\ninterests of humanity ”.452 This anti-anthropocentric stance is not new, as one can figure out\nby paying heed to 1970’s environmentalism. It came into being as a set of objections against\nthose human-centred traditions453 or, at least, against harmful human activities.454 Either\nway, as one will see below, it turns out useful for understanding why some contemporary\nthinkers-particularly those who promote the rights of Nature-are firmly convinced of a\nparadigm shift.\nSumming up, if the anthropocentric character of laws, public policies, and the judicial\nsystem constitute some of the principal sources of the current ecological crisis, one of the\nevident options would consist of changing that model. In that regard, one has argued,\nthroughout the whole study, that an alternative to cope with the environmental problems",

And,\nsecondly, it demands bestowing of legal representation, both before the courts of justice and\nwithin the international arena.\nNevertheless, before undertaking the analysis of this conferment of international legal\npersonhood to Nature, it would turn out crucial to enquire about the ethical foundations of\nthis possibility.

    "text": "Before passing to review the contents and scope of moral standing, it is worth indicating that\nthe terms “ moral standing ”, “moral considerability ”, “morality”, “moral status ”, and “moral\npatienthood ” are going to be used as synonyms, mainly to avoid misunderstandings. Their\nconceptual differences are so tiny in the philosophical parlance that one could ignore them\nentirely. The expressions “ moral personhood ” or “moral agency ”, eventually used, are other\nalternative expressions but only in strict reference to humans.455\nBy and large, as Joseph DesJardins explains, moral standing “[...] concerns questions\nof what things count, morally ”. Therefore “[a] n object has moral standing or deserves moral\nconsideration if it is the type of thing that rationally must be factored into any moral\ndeliberation ”.456 Strictly speaking, although Professor DesJardins mentions the objects\nfiguratively, moral standing deals primarily with an ethical criterion, pattern, measure, or\nrecognition of the level of importance, relevance, value, or significance that one entity\npossesses in front of others. This aspect generally becomes a dual process of granting rights\nand demanding duties.\nAs a result, one can find an extensive diversity of doctrinal positions, including new and\nvaried actors in the sphere of morality. It has brought about some epistemological hindrances\nderived from the [sometimes extreme] conceptual diversity of opinions. Effectively, since\nthe formal emergence of environmental ethics in the early 1970s, as a philosophical\ndiscipline oriented to deal with the relationship between humans and Nature, the idea of\nmoral status has become more and more confusing. It has more frequently occurred in a\ncontemporary context, primarily due to the expansion of the moral thresholds,457 in the\nfunction of capacity to suffer,458 the self-consciousness of its rights,459 having a life460 or\nbeing part of the biotic community,461 inter alia.\nConsequently, beyond the multiplicity of existing concepts, morality is not a feature\ncoming from oneself or depends directly on self-awareness. In practice, one cannot define\noneself as a moral agent or as a morally significant being. One necessarily relies upon the\njudgement of others to get convinced that one has acquired moral recognition.\nThe incoming chart # 32 is illustrative enough about how the plethora of criteria,\npatterns, and measures that form part of existing definitions contribute to the ambiguity and\ncomplexity of the concept, to the point that the contrasts are usually notable even within a\nsmall sample. Indeed, one could affirm that it is possible to find a different concept of moral\nconsiderability depending on almost every philosophical posture.",

    "text": "From the anthropocentric perspective, humans are the only beings who deserve moral\nstanding. Nevertheless, it seems to be clear this condition has not always been an immutable\nessence of all human beings in its origins, neither at all times nor in all places. Hierarchically,\nmoral status was only merited by freemen (e.g., group A) not by slaves (e.g., group B), by\nmen not by women (e.g., group C), by adults not by children (e.g., group D), and more\nrecently by alive people not by future generations (e.g., group E).\nThe history of knowledge is evidence. Just to remember, Aristotle deemed freemen held\na different category than slaves’, women’s, and children’s, occupying a superior locus over\nthem, founded on their lacking determination, weakness, and imperfection, respectively.\nFurthermore, there neither was equality in regard to their moral virtues, due to they were\nconnected directly to their position in the family or public sphere. Everybody possessed\n“reason”, but only freemen’s one was complete in an Aristotelian sense; the “[...] others\nwant only the portion of it which may be sufficient for their station [...]” he said. To him,\nslaves were merely things, “[...] one of those things which are by nature what they are [...]”.\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nB\nA\nC\nC\nB\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\nB\nB\nC\nC\nC\nC\nB\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\nB\nB\nC\nC\nC\nMoreover, he believed a slave was “ a particular species of property ” that the owner could\nemploy in what she or he wanted.462\nLikewise, regarding women, Aristotle remarked that humans are endowed of\n“courage” , but “[...] the courage of the man consists in commanding, the woman’s in\nobeying [...]”. Children had incomplete virtue instead, which “[...] is not to be referred to\nhimself in his present situation, but to that in which he will be complete [...]”.463\nIn sum, Aristotle designed a hierarchical conception to recognise as the ruler to whom\nwas in the higher position, while the others were the ruled.464 Over the years, however,\nthinkers and activists have been enlarging the bounds of morality from their respective action\nfields, in order to include new subjects of recognition and endow them with the same virtues\nand rights that their historically “superior” fellows held. Slavery has been a prime example.\nEffectively, slavery is the example par excellence of the expansion of that morality and\nthe granting of rights. Nash recalls how Slaves experienced both legal and moral\ntransmutation of their inherent nature, from being considered formerly mere objects or\ngoods, the property of others, to being recognised like human beings-their rightful\ncondition-within the social and legal spheres. Davis provides an explanation in detail about\nhow moral perceptions were shifting during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nregarding slavery.465\nMoreover, slavery was not seen as an utterly corrupt practice under moral principles\nduring centuries, above all referring to blacks, until groups of abolitionists called into\nquestion its ethical legitimacy to the point of going to war, such as the United States did it\nin 1861. Undoubtedly, there are older examples of abolition experiences, albeit with less\nhistorical resonance, such as the enactment of the decree to adopt the “ Freedom Principle ”\nby Louis X in France, in 1315, mentioned by Christopher Miller.466\nNowadays, although the Walk Free Foundation estimates about 40.3 million of people\nare in diverse modalities of modern slavery all over the world, this practice is penalised as a\nhidden crime, and consequently reproachable in a moral sense. Thus, it turns out undeniable\nthat there has been a real expansion of the limits of morality in this particular case.467",

Mary Wollstonecraft\nwrote in 1790 that virtues and knowledge of both sexes were naturally equal, and the only\nscientifically verifiable difference could be the male physical strength. Later, other authors,\nsuch as John Stuart Mill, Catherine Beecher, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Elizabeth Cady\nStanton, debated, reinforced, or supplemented her ideas. Feminist ethicists usually quote\nthese works.468\nThe unbalanced female situation in society persists in regard to sexual violence,469\nemployment opportunities,470 political participation,471 among other inequalities.472\nNonetheless, it seems doubtless that women are currently part of the classic moral\nconsiderability at the present day, due to people ethically condemn all those discriminatory\nbehaviours.\nThe experience of women makes up another case of moral frontiers’ extension, in which\nit is enough to glance at contemporary feminist literature and social activism to realise that\ndiscourses against male chauvinism and anti-sexism are powerful and overwhelming. For\ninstance, at the beginning of 2017, the feminist marches against Trump administration in the\nUnited States of America received full press coverage by national and international social\nmedia. Even Time magazine decided to feature the “ pussyhat”, a symbolic knitted red hat\nused by protesters, on its front cover. This image was re-tweeted more than ten thousand\ntimes.473\nThere is an enlargement of the moral boundaries of childhood as well. These days, no\ntheorists would defend the ancient Aristotelian perception about children, as immature\nspecimens, only expecting to reach the maturity with “[...] the structure, form, and function\nof a normal or standard adult ”.474 Likewise, nobody would support the enormous power of\n“life and death ” conferred by means of the Roman Patria Potestas on fathers, under which\nthey could even sell their children.475 As Butler affirms, children’s moral status is not in",

Furthermore, the expansion of rights,\nseen from legal and social terms, is frequently more illustrative than any ethical approach.\nIn that regard, one should affirm, as Christopher Stone magisterially suggests, that the\ninterconnectedness between the conferment of [fundamental] rights to new subjects of law\nand the concomitant expansion of the frontiers of moral standing towards themselves\nresponds to a parallel history. Thus, the holders of rights are usually deserving subjects of\nmoral standing and vice versa. Nevertheless, one should take into account that this\nparallelism does not necessarily consist of temporality, i.e., it does not simultaneously occur\nin the laws and ethics. A perfect example concerning that parallelism is relating to the case\nof children. Professor Stone recounts that, although the rights of children had been legally\nand 1970), they had counted on an overall moral acknowledgement a long time ago in\ntheoretical terms. “ We have been making persons of children [Stone alleges] although they\nwere not, in law, always so ”. It also occurs at the international level. For instance, although\none can trace some references about the children’s protection from the nineteenth century,\naccording to the chronology prepared by the International Catholic Child Bureau, the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child was barely adopted in 1989.484\nIn any event, a more or less similar argument Stone employs, although admitting certain\nincongruences, to elucidate the cases of prisoners, foreigners, women (especially married\nones), mentally ill people, blacks, foetuses, and Indians. To him, their legal recognition once\nwas “unthinkable ”, but along the history, it became morally, and above all legally,\nfeasible.485\nThis idea of the “ expanding concept of rights ” has been illustrated in an outstanding\nwork by Roderick Nash. He initially referred to the cases of the United States and the United\nKingdom. Nonetheless, to the best benefit of the present dissertation, chart # 34 below\ndisplays an adaptation to international law.\nSo far, the idea about the expansion of rights seems to be relatively simple to the extent\nthat the subjects at stake have been historically human beings. That is to say, although they\npossessed a legally different status, both free people and slaves shared the same human\nnature. Therefore, when their instrumental attributes (legal status) equated or overcame by\nmeans of the expansion of rights, their human essence (ethical value) manifested in itself",

Moral standing can prolong, as long as it deals with\nhumans, even towards future generations.489 In this regard, the recognition of moral status\ntowards forthcoming people entails in itself ontological and epistemological\nincongruence,490 which lies principally in determining if there is or there is no human duty\nto help them to meet their prospective needs.491\nSumming up, the discussion about moral considerability, from an anthropocentric point\nof view, does not involve Nature, given that natural resources constitute a set of goods that\nprovides nourishment, attire, and other services for human welfare. In this case, the right to\na healthy environment would encompass a better ambit of analysis, considering the\nadvantage of being the most well spread constitutional mechanism of Nature’s protection\nworldwide.492\nConsequently, under no circumstances, the bestowal of legal personhood or the\nconcession of rights on Nature can be categorised inside this anthropocentric outlook.",

Nevertheless, this expansion of morality does not encompass all living\norganisms, as Singer himself clarifies, because “[...] there comes a point [...] when it\nbecomes doubtful if the creature [...] is capable of feeling anything ”, e.g., oysters. In that\nsense, animal liberation promotes the bestowal of moral status only on higher mammals.495\nOn his part, Tom Regan contributed to the analysis with an approach grounded on\n“rights”, in a certain sense chastising Singer and other thinkers, both utilitarian and\ncontractarian, for denying the rights of animals. Regan believes in the intrinsic value of the\nso-called “ subjects-of-a-life ”, who are beings endowed of capacity to feel but also to become\naware of their desires, pleasures, perceptions, memories, future, preferences, welfare, and so\nforth. They are conscious individuals of “[...] what transpires “on the inside”, in the lives\nthat go [...] on behind their eyes ”. Accordingly, his perspective is even more restrictive than\nSinger’s, considering the category of subjects-of-a-life would be reserved only for “ mentally\nnormal mammals of a year or more ”. If a non-human being does not form part of this\ncategory, it will not deserve moral status in practice.496\nPhilosophical adversaries of both authors have detracted from their ideas, arguing the\nexcessive narrowness of their conditions for deserving moral considerability principally.\nAccording to Keller, their critics state that sentientism and self-awareness perpetuate the\narbitrariness of the anthropocentric hierarchies they pretend to combat. In a similar vein,\nCallicott points out that Singer and Regan ascribe mere instrumental value to plants or other\nanimals that cannot qualify inside any of their categories. Likewise, Rodman does not see\nany difference between what he calls “ zoocentrist sentientism ” and the selected rights that\nthe British aristocracy endowed to the upper-middle class, by means of the Reform Bill of\n1832. To him, the arbitrariness of conditions to deserve moral considerability is analogous\nin both circumstances.497\nTo summarise, the dogmatic teachings of animal liberation/rights ethics would\nencompass much better the idea about rights of Nature than anthropocentric doctrines do,\neven epistemologically, from an individualistic standpoint. Nevertheless, one cannot back\nup the conferment of international personhood, based upon their philosophical premises,\nbecause both schools of thought keep a restrictive structure of moral recognition, which is",

Effectively, the former is an\nexpression employed by Carter to categorise the superiority of higher animals over the other\nliving beings, mainly depicted by Singer, Regan, and Attfield. Instead, the latter corresponds\nto what Keller has pigeonholed into “ weak holism ”, which endows different degrees of\nintrinsic value, depending on how high or low is the position of the living being within the\nhierarchy. The use of “ hierarchical biocentrism ” is also shared by Brennan. Nevertheless,\nother ethicists, like Kaufman and DesJardins, do not label them expressly inside any\nparticular class, although they do point out their hierarchical character.500\nThe emergence of the second-phase extensionism, characterised by a life-centred\ninsight, could correspond to a dichotomy between correctness and complementarity. In\neffect, some thinkers, such as Callicott, see the enlargement of morality margins (towards a\nbroader range of living beings) as an attempt to rectify the arbitrary conditions of moral\nconsiderability, imposed by both anthropocentric and psychocentric worldviews. Others\nbelieve in, Keller suggests, the necessity to complete what fell short. To achieve their ends,\neither correcting the errors or adding what is missing, biocentrists appealed to a quite suitable\ntool, teleology.501\nIn this regard, the conception about that every organism is a “ teleological centre of life ”,\nendowed of uniqueness, individuality and whose final cause is the pursuit of its own good\non its own way, makes up one of the pillars of Taylor’s egalitarian biocentrism , and maybe\neven its backbone. In contrast to Regan, Singer, and even some hierarchical biocentrists , the\nfact of believing that all entities have a value in itself makes Taylor’s stance much more\ninclusive, in terms of moral considerability. Moreover, if one thinks about humans as fellows\nof nonhuman living beings, instead of a ranked relationship where humans are superior, it is\nunarguable that Taylor’s objective consists of the elimination of categories between them.\nIn other words, he promotes the “[...] belief that humans are not inherently superior to other\nliving things [...]”, which means equality.

He prefers speaking about the “ life principle ”, in\nwhich the sole “[...] condition of being alive seems [...] to be a plausible and nonarbitrary\ncriterion” of morality. This aspect makes possible to include a wider range of living beings,\nsuch as plants, for example, expanding somehow the verges of the “ conative life ” formerly\nproposed by Feinberg through his “ interest principle ”. However, to be fair, Goodpaster stops\nshort of affirming if moral importance is the same for all living beings or if there is any\ndifference, Keller explains. Indeed, there is no explicit reference to this issue within\nGoodpaster’s proposal.505\nIn Latin America, Eduardo Gudynas is probably the most respected scholar in matters\nof biocentric ethics. Notwithstanding, it turns difficult to pigeonhole his work entirely within\nthe ambit of biocentrism, due to his continued allusions to Pachamama, the Indigenous\nterminology to define the Mother Earth or Nature, with regard to the conferral of legal rights.\nAlthough he severely questions the anthropocentric notion of Nature as a “ mere aggregate\nof commodities or capitals ”, he instead visualises it as a “ conglomerate of living species ”,\nwhose intrinsic value emerges from each constitutive element. One cannot infer the existence\nof an interplay among living beings, above all, because he barely “assumes” but does not\nassure the presence of systemic or organicist attributes.506\nIn sum, his ethical stance could condense into one single paragraph: “[...] there is a\nbiocentric equality: all living species have the same importance, and all of them deserve to",

One will conserve both useful and useless species, those ones with and without\neconomic value, likewise the attractive and disgusting ones ”.507\nAdditionally, Attfield believes that Arne Næss and James Sterba can be deemed as part\nof this philosophical stance, although with some nuances. On his part, Keller agrees with\nNæss and includes other deep ecologists, such as Bill Devall and George Sessions. There is\na coincidence of opinions about the three latter authors between Keller and Mathews.\nNevertheless, being a radical posture, deep ecology will be addressed later within a different\nsubheading.508\nBy way of criticism, if the fact of conferring moral standing to specific animals was\ncontroversial per se, let alone the case of ascribing such recognition towards a more general\ncategory of nonhuman living beings individually. In this sense, the theories concerning the\nintrinsic value of life, in general, brings about a series of ethical objections and distortions\nof morality. Among the most recurrent ones, it is possible to identify the lack of a correlative\nduty among all living beings, their individualism, the increasing conflict derived from the\nexcessive interests at stake within the sphere of the biotic community, among others.\nNevertheless, the most complex hindrance perhaps consists of the ontological essence of the\nmoral struggle between complete organisms (e.g., humans, plants, or animals) and other\nliving agents, organs, or parts of them (e.g., virus, bacteria, archaea). The problem lies in the\nfact that all of them would deserve moral consideration under the sole condition of life.509\nIn consequence, the proposal regarding the amplification of the limits of moral standing\ntowards the whole living beings neither represents the best moral support for the legal\ndoctrine of Nature as a subject of law. It does not only deal with its controversial character,\nbut also with the fact that it brushes aside the abiotic component of the ecosystem,\ncontrasting severely with the legal scope of the present dissertation. So, one should abandon\nthe analysis of these postulates as well.",

Effectively,\nthe author differentiates between what he names “ weak holism ”, referring to the\ncollectiveness of living beings, from “ robust holism” regarding the “ wholes in themselves ”,\nwhich in the end implies the inclusion of the abiotic elements of the ecosystem, i.e., nonliving things.510\nIn contrast to the previously addressed doctrines, the inherent moral value does not\ncorrespond to an individualistic assignment, but rather to a collective one. In philosophical\nterms, the moral importance falls upon species, mountains, rivers, or other ecosystems, even\nthe planet. Thus, it would not turn out rare to think about moral values underlies the\nrecognition of legal personhood of rivers, glaciers and watersheds in Colombia, India, and\nNew Zealand. Something similar one could argue about the bestowal of rights on Nature in\nBolivia and Ecuador or the legal acknowledgement of natural environments in the United\nStates.\nIn essence, Callicott defines ecocentric ethics as the “[...] moral consideration for the\necosystem as a whole and for its various subsystems as well as for human and nonhuman\nnatural entities severally ”. Methodologically, ecocentrism constitutes a new paradigm for\nmoral philosophy, given that it does not follow the schematic standards of humanism and\nextensionism towards an increasing enlargement of moral limits. In other words, Keller\nexplains that ecocentrism does not deal with the process of expanding the moral circle\ntoward different polycentric individuals, depending on each theoretical tendency. It does not\nfollow the same logic of anthropocentrism, by expanding morality from people to people, or\nthe biocentrism, extending moral status towards subjects-of-a-life, sentient beings, or just\nliving beings. Ecocentrism is holistic rather and opposed to polycentric individualism.511\nNevertheless, it is worth making clear the technique of extending the thresholds of\nmorality was actually one of its methodological antecedents in the beginning and currently\nis an escape route for the criticisms. Indeed, Callicott uses this argument to champion the\nland ethic against the accusations of ecofascism. Aldo Leopold, probably its more prominent\nforerunner, has stated that “[...] land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community\nto include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land ”.512 Nowadays, authors\nlike Næss, Rolston III, Sessions, and Callicott took over shaping the theory.",

His celebrated statement, a “[...] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity,\nstability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise ”,513\nconstitutes an outstanding condensed version of his perspective about the biotic community,\nwhere an array of interdependent parts interacts among them, but also somehow of the\ngeneral postulates of holism in its purer form. Here precisely lies its importance.\nGiven the significant number of authors addressing ecocentric outlooks, a simple\nclassification of ethical trends is often handy support to expose the ideas in a more precise\nfashion. In this case, Keller’s taxonomy seems to be entirely accurate in didactic terms. As\nmentioned, he proposes a bifurcation between a “ weak holism ” and a “robust” one.

    "text": "Various contemporary ethicists515 identify Aldo Leopold as the initiator of the ecocentric\ntheories, or at least as one of their most transcendental exponents, to the point that his\nphilosophical repercussion often equates with Rachel Carlson’s concerning science.\nNevertheless, it is feasible to track the academic and historical pedigree of the holism in\nmuch more ancient times, mainly hand in hand with scientific developments. Indeed, some\nauthors, such as Davis, have even pondered the contradictions of molecular biology , based\non the teleological origin of the conflict between Democritus’ atomism and Aristotle’s\nholism. In short, atomism characterises by the individuality of the atoms merely moving by\nvirtue of neighbouring forces in a void, in front of the holism, in which the final causation\nof objects and systems subordinate their behaviour to a general plan or destiny. Moreover,\nin an aesthetic interpretation of holism, Anthony Price argues the value of each part is a\ncontribution to the value of the wholeness.516\nFrom the ethical point of view, however, this idea is not necessarily shared by ethicists,\nsuch as George Sessions, whose outstanding essay, “ Ecocentrism and the Anthropocentric\nDetour”, has been useful to guide this section, by the way. He attributes the early ecocentric\ndevelopments to “[...] the Nature-oriented [...] cosmological speculations of the PreSocratics [...]” rather than the philosophical strand of Aristotle, which ends in the wellknown hierarchical structure of the “ Great Chain of Being ”. In either event, it would turn\nout paradoxical the possibility of both anthropocentrism and ecocentrism could share the\nsame epistemological Greek roots, at least in theory.517\nGreek wisdom, though, is not the only reference about holistic views of Nature in the\npast, particularly regarding the question of moral values. Effectively, American Indian tribes,\nsuch as Micmac or Sioux, and especially Ojibwa,518 one of the largest indigenous peoples\nsettled in Canada and the United States, have lived governed by a close intimacy with the\nnatural world.",

See\nEncyclopædia Britannica (2016) para. 1st.\nIn that sense, Callicott narrates the worldview around the “ Indian’s social circle ”-\nSteiner prefers the expression “ circle of life” -where nonhuman entities, like the “[...] Earth\nitself, the sky, the winds, rocks, streams, trees, insects, birds, and all other animals [...]”\nwere “enspirited ” [sic] and possessed personalities, consciousness, reason and, volition as\nwell as the human beings.519\nDespite his critical attitude, Calvin Martin somehow seems to concur with this\nCallicott’s social interpretation of Indian cosmology initially. In effect, one can notice the\naffinity of ideas when Martin assures that Nature, for Ojibwa peoples, was a “[...] congeries\nof societies [where] every animal, fish and plant species functioned in a society that was\nparallel in all aspects to mankind’s. Wildlife and plant-life had homes and families, just as\nman did”. Nevertheless, later, Martin oddly casts doubt on the ethical validity of the ecofriendly attitude of Indians, arguing that the ecological impairments caused by them\ncontrasted with their presumed “[...] pristine sentiments toward Nature [...]”, among other\narguments. This opinion has been stringently criticised by Callicott, who has even branded\nit as “[...] another unjustifiably skeptical remark [...]”, despite admitting its extensive\ninfluence.520\nAccording to Sessions, one can trace another remote reference about ecocentrism in the\nthirteenth century, by means of Saint Francis of Assisi ’s thought. In this regard, Lynn White\nJr. deems that Saint Francis depicts a radical Christian view, mainly owing to his ideas about\nsetting up “ a democracy of all God’s creatures ”. White interprets this aspect as “[...] a\nunique sort of pan-psychism of all things animate and inanimate, designed for the\nglorification of their transcendent Creator [...]”. In the same vein, Augustine Thompson\nevokes some stories about Francis speaking to animals and other nonhuman creatures,\ncalling them brothers or sisters (e.g., brother sun, sister moon, brother fly, sister bird, brother\nfire, sister cricket, and so on). This habit denotes in some way perception of parity among\nhuman and nonhuman beings.521\nWhite asserts that Assisi failed in his attempt to promote equality among all creatures,\nincluding humans, and to substitute the notion of man vastly governing the whole creation.\nHowever, one of the most memorable remembrances of his thoughts and feelings remains\nuntil present times. Thompson, one of Assisi’s biographers, compiled this verse, included in\nthe “Canticle of Brother Sun ”, among whose lines one can read: “ Praised be you, my Lord,",

One proper manner\nto stress his philosophical contribution could consist of affirming, as Sessions has done, the\nphilosopher constituted the second opportunity-three centuries after Saint Francis-to shift\nthe anthropocentric course of Western culture. Nevertheless, the reading of Spinoza is not\nreadily comprehensible, so that has brought about numerous interpretations, at least as far as\nhis relationship with Nature is concerned. Anthony Smith’s elucidations, for example, could\nillustrate how wide the range of views regarding Spinoza could be. To Smith, Spinoza’s\nwork concerning ecology depicts an opposite manner of understanding. On the one hand, it\ndeals with a reductionist form of scientific reason. But, at the same time, it is a holistic source\nof deep ecologism.523\nMoreover, there is who adduces that one of the most eventful affirmations of Spinoza\nwas the so-called “ incremental naturalism ”, which would consist basically of the\ncomprehensive study of humans (including their mind) and their interactions with other\nelements, within the ambit of Nature and under the same governing principles. This\ninterpretation, coming from Garrett, grounds on a statement taken from Spinoza’s Ethics. In\na sort of sarcastic tone, one can read that those who “[...] have written about the affects524\n[sic] and man’s conduct of life seem to discuss, not the natural things which follow the\ncommon laws of nature, but things which are outside her. They seem indeed to consider man\nin nature as a kingdom within a kingdom. ” As a consequence, under the umbrella of this\nincremental naturalism, one could explain certain human feelings-such as intentionality,\ndesire, belief, understanding, and consciousness-from their most rudimentary expressions\nin the natural world. In other words, “[...] humanity can be seen as a complex and\nsophisticated expression of nature [...]”, which somehow implies an interpretative\nreminiscence of anthropocentric extensionism.525\nIn any event, Arne Næss is who has principally stood up for the ecocentric connotations\nfrom Spinoza’s philosophy, as one can observe through various essays and other works\npublished the late twentieth century. The core idea rests on how both Spinoza and deep\necologism define and interpret the term “ Nature”, emphasising its connection with the",

In his words, “[...] that eternal and infinite Being whom we\ncall God or Nature [Spinoza asserts] acts by the same necessity by which He exists; for we\nhave shown that He acts by the same necessity of nature as that by which He exists .” It drives\nto muse on some epistemological and semantic aspects, explained by Arne Næss mainly in\nhis celebrated article “ Spinoza and Ecology ”.526 Those concerning holism gets emphasised\nbelow.\nFirstly, as one can notice, it seems that the words “ God” and “Nature” had the same\nmeaning for Spinoza or, at least, were quite close. There are several references in his work,\nEthic. This semantic correlation is crucial to Næss because it allows him to unfold the\nsubsequent idea concerning the perfection of Nature.527\nSecondly, therefore, Næss believes that Spinoza’s Nature “ is perfect in itself ”, like God,\nwhich implies the existence of an entity inherently “ creative”, “infinitely diverse ”, “alive”\nand “structured ”, according to the general “ laws of nature ”, namely it deals with a notion of\n“Nature”, very close to the gist of the deep ecology’s one. Indeed, Næss writes the word\n“Nature” with capital N to emphasise the depiction of God, maybe as a form of “[...] secular\ndivinity perfect in itself that has been unbalanced by the actions of humanity ”, following\nSmith’s reading.528\nThirdly, under the conception of deep ecology or ecosophy529, all things are\ninterconnected. In that sense, Næss asserts there is a “[...] network of cause-effect relations\nconnecting everything with everything .” To him, nothing is causally inactive. Moreover, he\neven supports his argument on what Barry Commoner has called the first law of Ecology,\ni.e., “everything is connected to everything else ”. In his discourse, in effect, Spinoza seems\nto encompass a relationship of cause-effect in what he calls the order and connection of\nideas and things, which for him are the same, by the way . “For the idea of anything caused\n[he asserts] depends upon a knowledge of the cause of which the thing caused is the effect ”.\nLater, he explains that the “ circle” of things existing in Nature, according to God’s idea,\nfollows the same order, the same connection of causes, and the same sequence of things.\nThis series of arguments, interpretatively, allows understanding to some extend how Næss\nreaches his conclusion of interconnectedness in deep ecology.530",

See Næss (1973) 99.\n530 Spinoza (1883) 52-3; Næss (1977) 48; Commoner (1974) 29.\nFinally, one last element of analysis refers to how Spinoza sees the relationship between\nhumans and animals. Although he recognises the differences altogether, he interestingly\npoints out that the same right which animals have over people, people have over animals.\nThough, to him, “[...] since the right of any person is limited by his virtue or power, men\npossess a far greater right over brutes than brutes possess over men .”531 At first glance, the\nidea about the balance of rights between animals and humans does not need too much\nexplanation, at least from an ecological insight, although Næss has attempted to\ncontextualise some extra elements, mainly concerning the differences.\nEffectively, apropos of his comments about Genevieve Lloyd’s article, Næss displays\nseveral examples to demonstrate a particular license of Spinoza to admit some similar, and\neven identical, characteristics shared by humans and animals. He refers, for instance, to the\ndesires of procreation, lusts and appetites, which eventually denotes an idea of moral\ncommunity or fellowship, where humans can treat animals as valuable in themselves, such\nas it occurs in ecology with each “ living thing ”.532\nIn the same line, one aspect that Næss does not take into account, perhaps just\nincidentally, comprises the semantic sense of what one should understand by the expression\n“natural objects ”, in which Spinoza seems to include both animate and inanimate things.\nThere is somehow an instrumental connotation as well. It occurs, for instance, when Spinoza\nasserts that natural objects are a means to obtain what is profitable and usable by humans.\nThus, “[...] the eyes, which are useful for seeing, the teeth for mastication, plants and\nanimals for nourishment, the sun for giving light, the sea for feeding fish [...]”, among\nothers. Moreover, it underlies the idea that God created those things for humans, and they\nare different from artificial ones.533\nSumming up, Spinoza’s stance inevitably suggests the constant interaction of humans\nand Nature, especially those living beings, within an orbit of balanced links. Nevertheless,\none cannot deny the author often recognises, and even highlights sometimes their\ndifferences. There is an overall sense of coexistence, as in a community or a membership.",

Despite the criticisms about the\nsuperficial character of Thoreau’s writings in matters of the natural world, Roderick Nash\nhas also asserted he was one of the ecologists before ecology , in reference to the argument\nset out by Worster, regarding the appearance of the term “ecology” barely in the 1860s but\nafter Thoreau passed away.534\nIn effect, Worster explains that the word “ oecology”, and later “ ecology” as its current\nspelling, has been attributed to Ernst Haeckel in 1866 (Laferrière and Stoett affirm it\noccurred in 1867). Effectively, it refers to “[...] the science of the domestic side of organic\nlife, of the life-needs of organisms and their relations to other organisms with which they\nlive [...]”, which one can read in Haeckel’s works.535\nBroadly speaking, his book of experiences in the woods, “ Walden”,536 reflects much of\nThoreau’s convictions regarding the environmental matters. Nonetheless, his opinion about\nthe morality of Nature could be better summarised probably in the widely quoted phrase\nfrom his Journal, “[w] hat we call wildness is a civilization other than our own ”.537 To him,\nthis declaration contradicts the generalised connotation of reading the terms wildness and\ncivilisation as antonyms, as the depiction of sin ( wildness) and virtue ( tameness), so that\npines, hen-hawks and other similar living beings are consequently his “ friends”.538\nApropos of Thoreau’s stories, one can find numerous references concerning this kind of\n“wild community ”, so to speak, disseminated around his prolific academic production. In his\nJournal’s notes, for instance, Thoreau also refers to animals as “ companions ” or “fellowcreatures ”, even suggesting they could constitute some kind of society with humans. He\ncame to equate cats and humans, affirming that albeit the latter “[...] do not go to school,\nnor read the Testament; yet how near they come to doing so! [Thoreau stated] How much\nthey are like us who do so! ” As part of his often-figurative discourse, he treats certain natural\nelements like his peers, either allies or enemies of labour. Adequately, while describing some\nof his summer activities in the woods, the author accounts that his “[...] auxiliaries are the\ndews and rains which water this dry soil, [while his] enemies are worms, cool days, and",

It deals with a sort of metaphor that turns around the ecocentric\nsymbolism, by including not only biotic elements.539\nFinally, Thoreau complemented his vision about the relationship between Nature and\nhumans quite well, through another assert also taken from his Journal, “[t] he earth I tread\non is not a dead, inert mass. It is a body, has a spirit, is organic, and fluid to the influence\nof its spirit, [s]he is not dead but asleep ”,540 which to some extent anticipated to the Gaia\nhypothesis.\nAnother remarkable figure of the ecocentric philosophy is undoubtedly John Muir . He\nfelt attracted strongly to Nature after observing a group of rare white orchids, as it has been\nwell-documented by his commentators.541 Muir published his copious scholar work between\nthe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He also co-founded and exercised the first\npresidency of Sierra Club,542 one of the oldest and most prestigious environmental\norganisations of the United States. Muir, like Thoreau, used to write in an evocative language\nand kept a journal, where one can discover some of his unrevealed beliefs and attitudes\ntoward Nature.\nWhen he is speaking about his experiences in Yosemite Park, for example, one\ndistinguishes precise ecocentric parlance supported on characteristic expressions, such as\nbrother or fellow, for referring to nonhumans. “ Your animal fellow beings, [Muir\nemphasises] so seldom regarded in civilization, and every rock-brow and mountain, stream,\nand lake, and every plant soon come to be regarded as brothers; even one learns to like the\nstorms and clouds and tireless winds [...]”.543\nIn terms of environmental ethics, his narration about the quest of a vessel in Cedar\nKeys,544 chapter six of his “ A thousand-mile walk to the Gulf ” is quite probably the most\nalike portrayal of his beliefs regarding the interplay between Nature and humans. Beyond\nthe descriptions of the place [he even shows a hand-made picture by himself], the core of\nthe text contains a severe criticism of the anthropocentric connotations of traditional ethics.\nMuir holds the planet has not been exclusively made for humans, as one could corroborate\nthrough the existence of venomous beasts, thorny plants, or deadly diseases, which he",

He assures that humans and other creatures are made\nfrom the same material so that they are “ earth-born companions ” and “fellow mortals ”.545\nIn this line of reasoning, Muir poses the core question of ecocentrism, bringing into\nquestion the existence of specific values for humans. He asks, “ why should man value\nhimself as more than a small part of the one great unit of creation? ” Moreover, he even casts\ndoubt on the complete absence of sensations in abiotic elements, such as minerals, arguing\nthe lack of mechanisms of communication with humans, which allow corroborating this\ncircumstance. Muir also highlights the functional role of people, in comparison with other\nliving beings, affirming that “[a] fter human beings have also played their part in Creation’s\nplan, they too may disappear without any general burning or extraordinary commotion\nwhatever”.546\nTo conclude, some authors, such as Mighetto or Nash, have emphasised Muir’s “ intense\nlove of animals ” in a manner that could lead to pigeonholing him within the defenders of the\nrights of animals, i.e., under a biocentric connotation. Indeed, there is an explicit reference\nabout the recognition of rights of animals in a 1904-letter to Henry Fairfield Osborn, member\nof the Boone and Crockett Club, the oldest wildlife conservation organisation in North\nAmerica, founded in 1887 by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell. Muir called\nthe practice of hunting the murder business “[...] because the pleasure of killing is in danger\nof being lost from there being little or nothing left to kill, and partly, let us hope, from a dim\nglimmering recognition of the rights of animals and their kinship to ourselves ”. The same\nparagraph appears quoted in the compilation of random thoughts by Edwin Teale. Moreover,\nMuir affirms ironically that doctrine has “[...] taught that animals [...] have no rights that\nwe are to respect, and were made only for man, to be petted, spoiled, slaughtered, or\nenslaved”.547\nIn that regard, after a detailed search, it is possible to identify some express allusions to\nthe “rights of the rest of creation ”,548 which would imply a robust ecocentric conception.\nFurthermore, Muir himself dispelled any doubts, arguing that “[...] all of the individual\n‘things’ or ‘beings’ into which the world is wrought are sparks of the Divine Soul variously\nclothed upon with flesh [animals] leaves [plants], or that harder tissue called rock, water,",

To Muir, morality did not stop with animals, Nash states.549\nGeorge Santayana was a prolific writer of literature and philosophy. Both in intellectual\ncircles and popular wisdom, one can often listen to his famous aphorism, “ Those who cannot\nremember the past are condemned to repeat it ”, published in his also celebrated, “ The Life\nof Reason ”. Concerning the subject at hand, he asserted: “ I was thus fully settled in my\nnaturalistic convictions [...]”, while was admitting naturalism had directly to do with “[...]\nthe origin and history of mankind [...]”. Greeks and especially Spinoza were his primary\nsources of thought in matters of environmental morality, as Santayana himself has\nrecognised. Indeed, he considered Spinoza as his “ master and model ”, being his lessons the\nfoundation of Santayana’s philosophy. To Coleman, one of Santayana’s commentators, the\ncombination between these two quite different traditions were not “thoroughgoing”, but\n“[...] complementary influences on Santayana’s thought, compensating for each other’s\ndeficiencies ”.550\nAlthough there is not any reference about Santayana in the most spread compilations of\nenvironmental ethics, not even in the Encyclopaedia by Callicott and Frodeman, his\ninclusion in a review of holistic tendencies makes sense mainly as a straight antecedent of\ndeep ecology. Indeed, Sessions has confessed his admiration for Santayana as “[...] one of\nthe most striking instances of early twentieth-century ecocentrism ”. He has looked into\nSantayana’s work from a critical perspective of American philosophy to the point of\nconsidering him-especially along with Thoreau and Muir-as the third opportunity to leave\nthe “anthropocentric detour ”. Saint Francis and Spinoza, in chronological order, had been\nthe two first ones.551\nTo outline Santayana’s principal contributions to ecocentric thought, Sessions and other\nethicists had utilised a well-known excerpt taken from a 1911-lecture, delivered before the\nPhilosophical Union of the University of California. During that event, Santayana briefly\narticulated his discrepancies with how American philosophers had conceived the egotistical\nand anthropocentric manner, in which human reason was constituting “[...] the centre and\npivot of the universe [...]”. Moreover, to his mind, American intellectuals had not been able\nto influence for the imposition of any restriction to or, at least, elaborate a consistent",

In a metaphorical sense, Santayana frequently compared the conflict between\nwishes and reasons with the differences between classical and modern architecture. In\nother words, while “[t] he American Will inhabits the sky-scraper; the American Intellect\ninhabits the colonial mansion [he asserted] [t] he one is all aggressive enterprise; the other\nis all genteel tradition ”.552\nNevertheless, according to Santayana, there was solely one exception to that gentle\ntradition of American intellectuals, Walt Whitman, who had been capable of abandoning\nthis human-centred perception by means of an extension of democracy “[...] to the animals,\nto inanimate nature, to the cosmos as a whole ”. In a clear-cut reference to ecocentrism, it\ndealt with a democracy somehow exercised within the ambit of psychology and morality.\nThe quotation is also present in Sessions and Garrido.553\nTo the aim of this research, it is particularly significant Santayana’s reproach to\nEmerson’s transcendentalist notion about Nature as a commodity. This diatribe constitutes\none of the sources supporting the critical stance about the anthropocentric relationship\nbetween Nature and property.\nEffectively, Emerson stated that Nature “[...] is not only the material, but is also the\nprocess and the result [where] [a] ll the parts incessantly work into each other’s hands for\nthe profit of [hu]man”. Moreover, to him, the “[...] influence of the forms and actions in\nnature, is so needful to man, that, in its lowest functions, it seems to lie on the confines of\ncommodity and beauty ”.554\nIn response, Santayana held this transcendentalist assertion represented an instrumental\nview of Nature, where the evocation of human work and the aesthetic conception of the wild\ndetermined somehow its value or, in other words, “ his [Emerson’s] love and respect for\nNature”.555 On his part, Sessions believes it is ironic that John Muir, one of the emblematic\nfigures of early ecocentrism, have been alive at the time of Santayana’s criticisms. He\npresumes that Santayana was looking at Thoreau and Muir as a mere extension of Emerson’s\nthought.556\nIn Latin America, the concept of Pachamama is precisely the epitome of an ancient\naboriginal conception of the wholeness.

Indeed, one can translate the expression into Aymara,\nKichwa or Quechua, which are languages mainly spoken in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.\nCurrently, notwithstanding Eduardo Gudynas ’ caveat about the imprecise scope of the\ninterpretation, Pachamama has been construed as “ mother earth ” in legal jargon. Something\nsimilar has occurred in the environmental vocabulary, according to Mamani-Bernabé.557\nPhilosophically speaking, one of the most remote references about Pachamama belongs\nto Rodolfo Kusch . He discovered that ancient natives used to associate the term with a visible\nor day-to-day perception of “ land”, i.e., “what there is here ”, “what one sees growing ”,\nseparately from the idea of “ Pacha” (meaning “ cosmos” or “habitat”). In effect, Kusch\nhighlights the suggestive verbatim translation: “ mother or wife of the Pacha ”, which could\nget interpreted as segregation from higher divinities. Kusch is part-probably even the\nforerunner-of a group of philosophers (Mignolo, Escobar, Boff, among others) who conform\n“[...] the ancient ethos and biocultural landscapes of Amerindian people ”. In contrast to\nthem, there is a group of thinkers who have attempted to incorporate the green philosophical\nthinking into the South American academic circles (i.e., Rozzi). In any event, some authors,\nsuch as Gudynas, are tending to articulate this approach with ecocentric worldviews, mainly\ndeep ecology, and the land ethic.558\nAlthough Walt Whitman and Gary Snyder are not precisely philosophers of\nenvironmental issues, some authors have analysed and interpreted parts of their poetry since\nthe point of view of ecocriticism. Thus, in Whitman’s work, one should emphasise mainly\nthe differences between human-centred worldview and ecocentric one, within the ambit of\nthe “environmental literature ”. Santayana assured that Whitman was a pantheist, but whose\npantheism was different from Stoics’ and Spinoza’s, namely “ unintellectual, lazy, and selfindulgent ”. Indeed, he claimed the possibility of expressing it in a kind of bond between\npsychology and morality within Whitman’s concept of democracy.559 Hitherto, the vast\nsimilitudes (Annexe # 3.10) that Whitman found are still resounding.\nOn his part, in 1969, the poet Gary Snyder evoked the representation of living Nature\nunder the umbrella of what he called “ the wilderness ”, prompting to formulate a “[...] new\ndefinition of humanism and a new definition of democracy that would include the nonhuman,\nthat would have representation from those spheres ”. In addition, he narrated the experience",

For the aims of the present dissertation, his opinion about\nthe extension of morality toward Nature is invaluable.

It\ncomprises of life-support, economics, recreation, science, aesthetics, genetic-diversity,\nhistory, cultural-symbolisation, character-building, diversity, unity, stability, spontaneity,\ndidactics, life, and religion.563\nOne significant aspect for the aim of this dissertation is the role that ownership plays in\nthe determination of moral values, according to Rolston III’s thought. To him, moral value\nassociates with ownership, insofar as the latter endows a worth in itself. The author employs\n“life” as an example, assuring that there is a “value ownership” when an “[...] organism has\nsomething it is conserving, something for which it is standing: its life ”, namely the organism\nowns its life, and that relationship of pertaining determines the value of living in ethical\nterms. Nevertheless, one should consider some other reasons in the determination of such\nmoral significance. Thus, the organism deems not only the ownership but also the fact that\nlife keeps it stood. To Rolston III, those additional considerations are “ projections ” of\nsentiments that solely exists in the human mind. In other words, this somewhat refined\nrelationship of possession does not necessarily depict reality because it could involve\nimaginary scenes. For instance, aesthetic features depend on the viewer’s mind and are\nusually the result of cumulative human experiences (“ experienced value ”). They pertain to\nthe ambit of the subjectivity while they stay inside human intimacy.564\nOn the other hand, those human experiences are constructions arose out of excitements\nand desires, which becomes objective when their subjectivity turns “ inevitable ”. In a certain\nsense, it means the “ subjective ” perceptions get materialised in “objective” realities; for\nexample, “[...] not reducing penguin value to people experience but extending value from\nsubjective people experiences to objective penguin lives ”. As an interpretation, it seems the\nauthor recognises that those owned sentiments or desires could be not exclusively humanistic\nso that they can transmute towards other external concerns. Therefore, mere empathy for\npenguins transforms in real worrying for their existence. Likewise, they could also be selfish\nand lead solely to the search for personal welfare. In any case, the valuer is the owner of its\ninterests. The thread running through his reasoning gives the impression that Rolston III\nthinks of animals, plants, and ecosystems as “ value objects ”, denying any potential moral\nagency.565",

Hence its alternative label makes sense, hierarchical biocentrism .\nRolston III dedicates the entire chapter two of his Environmental Ethics to discuss the\nexistence of higher and lower beings, emphasising the position of human beings at the top\nof the scale. He states that “[...] humans are of the utmost value in the sense that they are\nthe ecosystem’s most sophisticated product ”, which turns out a thoroughly anthropocentric\nview, at least from the axiological and existential perspectives.566 Indeed, Rolston III assures\nthat humans are the “ ablest form of life ”, whose superiority bases on the Darwinian notion\nof “evolutionary achievement ”, materialised-for instance-through the development of\nculture, art, literature, philosophy, natural history, and science.567\nIn addition, although the biocentrism of Rolston III corresponds to a hierarchy\ndiscriminated in the function of sentience, at least among the higher animals, one should not\nconfuse it with Singer’s and Regan’s psychocentrism, in which feelings also play a crucial\nsentientists, who proclaim that values are reserved for higher animals capable of suffering\nor being self-aware of themselves, both spatially and temporally, weak holists believe in the\nassignation of values to all living beings , although considering different degrees of intensity\nregarding sentiments. Effectively, Rolston III adduces that “[h] igher animals suffer the\nmore because they can form plans and carry them out; their sentience joins with their\nintentions and frustrations ”. Hence, they can occupy an upper place than other organisms,\nsuch as insects or plants, in the pyramidal structure of values. They merit definitively higher\nworth.568\nInterestingly, Professor Desjardins labels the explanation of Rolston III’s value system\nas one of “[...] the best philosophical account [s] of the values that support a comprehensive\nenvironmental ethics ”. It works out like a ladder, in which every rung represents a value\ninterconnected one another. Every level has an inherent value in itself because one can stand\non it, but it is merely instrumental to the next step. “ Instrumental value uses something as a\nmeans to an end; intrinsic value is found worthwhile in itself without necessary contributory\nreference ”. Furthermore, Rolston III states that one cannot speak about value without an\nevaluator, who assesses the importance of others selectively . Thus, for instance, although",

Likewise, insects\nprobably put a value on the energy generated by plants, while in turn are essential for\nwarblers, and warblers become crucial to falcons. The food chain will consequently unfold\nto reach higher animals and humans in the end.569\nAlthough the structure of Rolston III’s value system looks simple at first sight, the\ncombination of elements taken from different philosophical sources turns it pretty complex\nto a certain extent. Keller, for example, appears to feel uncomfortable with the recurrent\noverlap between science and religion, stemmed from the author’s Christian bias. At times,\nRolston III sounds contradictory, such as when he arguably adduces neither biocentrism nor\nanthropocentrism defines his ethical system, given that it “[...] does not center\nindiscriminately on life [or] functionally on humans ”. Notwithstanding, as mentioned, living\nbeings are bound one another as the supply of food for other’s life sake-in Rolston’s values\nscheme-while humans are on the top of that system.570\nIn addition, Rolston III advocates the theory of “ autonomous intrinsic value ”, in which\n“[b]iotic communities leave individuals ‘on their own’ as autonomous centers, spontaneous\nsomatic selves defending their life programs ’. This autonomy implies a subjective\nconception of moral standing, where only humans are responsible for protecting what they\n“[...] have been given on the Earth ”. And solely homo sapiens are moral agents because\nthey are the only beings who have the “ inherent moral capacity ” to take care of the natural\nworld. The author affirms emphatically that “[p] lants and animals do not have such\nresponsibilities, much less do rivers and mountains ”. They are not agents but patients and,\ntherefore, the object of moral concern.571\nConsequently, the Earth is valuable in a humanistic sense, meaning that it can produce\nan instrumental value, endowing to humans a right to an environment with integrity. Under\nRolston III’s vision, a conception of rights of Nature is “[...] comical, because the concept\nof rights is an inappropriate category for nature ”. It is alright for rhetorical, poetic, or even\nlamentation purposes, but not for taking them seriously. His reproaches are particularly\nstringent with Muir and Leopold.572",

Inspired in\nAlfred North Whitehead, the author fosters the so-called “ Personalistic Organicism ”. It\ndeals with a moral mechanism to supplement the inadequacy of land ethic to address specific\nhuman concerns and to overcome the absence of interconnections between environmental\nand social principles that he notices in Rolston III’s ethical position.573\nEffectively, albeit Ferré accepts the enormous constructive influence of Leopold in the\nrealm of environmental ethics, and the subsequent validity of Callicott’s interpretation, he\nchallenges land ethic, grounded on three basic arguments. Firstly, he is not thoroughly sure\nof the existence of enough information about the actions to take for enhancing the “ integrity,\nstability, and beauty of the biotic community ”, according to the currently available biological\nand ecological breakthroughs. Therefore, it would lead to the risk of implementing erratic\npublic policies, even harmful to the environment. Secondly, Ferré considers that Land Ethic\nignores precise transcendent dimensions of moral life, focusing exclusively on the aim of\nmeeting the “ integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community ”. For instance, he\nbelieves that land ethicists would be omitting the moral assessment regarding how right or\nwrong some specific human conducts are, either factual ones such as telling lies or more\nabstract dilemmas, such as the slavery or torture. Thirdly, Ferré holds a severe opinion\nconcerning the theoretical option of considering morally right the deliberate extermination\nof humans, as a mechanism to achieve the aims of “ integrity, stability, and beauty of the\nbiotic community ”.574\nNevertheless, his last inference arises out of an interpretation that seems to overweight\nthe biological variables with regard to the problem of overpopulation. One can notice certain\nparallelism with Regan’s opinion about ecofascism. In the aftermath, Ferré completely\ndiscards the land ethic as guidance in crucial ethical situations, even feeling afraid that\ndespite being a “[...] refreshing change from anthropocentrism, Leopold’s vision could\neasily swing to the opposite extreme and become an excuse for radical misanthropy ”.575\nAs to Rolston III’s ethical doctrine, Ferré brings into question the “ sharp separation ”\nbetween social and environmental ethics, alleging it leads to a moral incoherence. Rolston\nIII had argued thereon that both ethics are not the same scope, supporting his ideas in the\ncase of predation. To him, predation is ecologically right, a painful good , because it",

Still, society condemns it to the point that humans\nhave been isolated from it, grounded on their right to be rescued. Moreover, Rolston III\nclaims that sentiments (pleasure and pain) are not the sole or the most important measures\nof value. He believes in living beings, playing their roles, and blossoming within their niches,\n“[...] with increasingly distinctive organic individuality as one goes up the system ”.576\nIn that regard, however, Ferré sees the dualism between the two kinds of ethics as\nincongruent because it leads to an unsolved disjunctive when it deals with a conflict between\nhumans and nonhumans. By means of the case of deforestation in the global South, he\nwonders what ethical approach should be employed, social or environmental. He deems that\nwhile the first line of action favours the alleviation of poverty (social ethics), in turn, it\ndepletes biodiversity, contributes to global warming, and fosters destructive anthropogenic\nencroachments (environmental ethics). According to Ferré, “ Rolston's answer is not much\nhelp [because he] acknowledges that there is nothing unusual in ‘higher trophic levels’\n(including human, cultures) ‘eating up’ lower ones. ”577\nAs Rolston III’s stance, Ferré’s “ Personalistic Organicism ” also focuses on the idea of\n“[...] different degrees of value on a common scale [but] discriminating moral choices [...]\nnot always or automatically in favor of human interests ”. It will constitute a mechanism to\nsolve the alleged lack of interconnection between human and nonhuman worlds.\nFurthermore, at this stage, it turns out convenient to recall that Ferré has practically\ndismissed land ethic . Instead, he is proposing a kind of bridge between the social and\nenvironmental ethics of Rolston III, which ends in a completely new system of values, based\non the intensity of experiences.578\nFirstly, Ferré seizes a semantic interpretation of the words “ artificial” and “natural”,\ngranting them different degrees of intensity. He states, for instance, that “[a] n apple orchard\nis more artificial than a forest, but a plastic apple is more artificial yet ”. His objective\nconsists of handling all ethical elements within a unique structure of values, the\n“naturalness ”. Secondly, such as Rolston III’s system, personalistic organicism requires the\nparticipation of “ valuers”, who possess intrinsic values for their own sake, and instrumental\nvalues, which are going to be the object of valuation.

Given his discourse seems to leap from\nNature’s intrinsic value to human dignity every once in a while, Ott, Frodeman, and Callicott\nhave pigeonholed him among the group of the European biocentrists.582 For example, one\ncould read between the lines that he accepts the possibility of a human trust in the biosphere\nwith the subsequent legal implications concerning the administration of natural resources, in\npractice.

By the way, Diehm presents a more detailed analysis of\ndeep ecology and phenomenological methodology. In either event, as Keller assures, the\nscholar scheme of deep ecology comprises of two vital tenets, the axiology of biocentric\negalitarianism and the ontology of metaphysical holism .586\nRegarding the first principle, one should recall that the philosophical category of\nbiocentric egalitarianism , or also egalitarian biocentrism , has been encompassed mainly by\nPaul Taylor and Kenneth Goodpaster, according to myriad authors.587 Taylor himself has\neven assigned it the personal label of “ biotic egalitarianism ”.588 This ethical stance, though,\nis not necessarily comparable to deep ecology , at least in terms of theoretical scope. The\ndifference lies in the manner how Næss has tackled his “ biospherical egalitarianism-in\nprinciple”, particularly as part of his widely known essay, “ The Shallow and the Deep, LongRange Ecology Movement ”. Effectively, the core difference regards the insertion of the\nsemantic clause, “ in principle ”. Næss does not speak about a mere “ ecological or\nbiospherical egalitarianism ”, where every single being possesses an equal value. He refers\nto an “ecological or biospherical egalitarianism- in principle ”, in which he admits that “[...]\nany realistic praxis necessitates some killing, exploitation, and suppression ”.589\nNæss’ astute proposal undoubtedly presupposes the existence of a type of beings who-\nunder specific circumstances-are going to bring their values to bear upon others’, such as it\noccurs in the food chain, for example. In other words, the function of this “ in principle ”\nclause is quite powerful, above all considering it strikes at the essence of the theory, adding\n“an exception to the rule ”. One should remember that Richard Watson, for example, brought\ninto question the biocentric egalitarianism, arguing it treated the human actions like antinatural ones. If humans, Watson affirms, “[...] destroy many other species and themselves\nin the process , they do no more than has been done by many another species ”. In this line of\nreasoning, Keller is in the right when he upholds that Næss was pretty shrewd due to the use\nof the qualifier “in principle ” because it allowed to deep ecologists endowed their theory\nwith higher philosophical consistency. Notwithstanding, ecosophy defenders should\nrecognise that clause has not avoided the criticisms.590",

He argues that, in the ambit of deep ecology, humans and nonhumans\nhave values in themselves, but they are not equal. It does not mean, though, that he believes\nin a hierarchy of values. Quite the contrary, in his Deep Ecology, written jointly with Bill\nDevall, he states that ecological consciousness is “[...] in sharp contrast with the dominant\nworldview of technocratic-industrial societies [...]”. It implies a rejection of the view of\nhumans as a superior category, isolated from the rest of the natural world.591\nIn this point, one wonders if there is any contradiction around the deep-ecologists’\narguments, principally considering they promote the differentiation of moral values while\ndenying their hierarchy. The crux of the matter lies definitively in the semantic qualifier “ in\nprinciple”, by circumventing that the circumstantial application of priorities among beings\nshould get deemed as an anthropocentric recognition of any supremacy, especially in favour\nof humans. Killing, exploitation, and suppression-to put it in Næss’ words-are crucial\nrelations for the subsistence of the biospherical net, not only for the human sake.\nAccordingly, Næss upholds that his “[...] intuition is that the right to live is one and the\nsame for all individuals, whatever the species, but the vital interests of our nearest,\nnevertheless, have priority ”. This idea that fits quite coherently with his argument that “[...]\nthe equal right to live and blossom is an intuitively clear and obvious value axiom ”. In sum,\nwithout this “ in principle ” clause, deep ecology would transmute into a mere “ hierarchical\nbiocentrism ” that would reinforce the Western anthropocentrism and would lead to a failure\nof the norm concerning the “ecological egalitarianism in principle ”, Sessions concludes.592\nThe second fundamental tenet of Deep Ecology concerns to the “ metaphysical holistic\nworldview ”, unfolded by means of the so-called “ self-realisation ”. DesJardins explains it\npretty clearly, “[s] elf-realization is a process through which people come to understand\nthemselves as existing in a thorough interconnectedness with the rest of nature [so that] all\norganisms and beings are equally members of an interrelated whole [...]”. However, Næss\nclarifies this process does not carry out in isolation. One’s self-realisation hinders, he argues,\nif the self-realisation of others, with whom one identifies, also hampers. In a certain way,\nthe individual self-realisation contributes to the self-realisation of the whole, as Devall and\nSessions contend: “[a] ll things in the biosphere have an equal right to live and blossom and",

EgoMetaphysical Self\nTo prevent confusions, it is worth reiterating, however, that Næss’ assertion about the\nexclusion of Nature does not have to do with a strict description of reality, but rather with a\nquestion of philosophical method. Therefore, the absence of Nature within the process of\nidentification toward other living fellows refers exclusively to a philosophical description\nthat anthropocentrists circumvent and deep ecologists promote. One could easily elaborate\nthis inference from the Næss’ anecdote about how he once saw a flea dying burned by acid,\nwithout any possibility to help it. He describes the painful feelings of compassion and\nempathy, which are useful to characterise the process of identification, “ I saw myself in the\nflea” Næss recalls. In this line of reasoning, identification acts as a precondition of\ncompassion toward other living beings, similarly to solidarity among humans.596\nOn the other hand, the radicalism of the academic postures, coming from deep\necologists, could transfigure in practice through the platform of principles designed by Næss,\naccompanied by Sessions. Beyond the nature of its contents, which are quite understandable,\nas DesJardins observes, the crux of the matter resides in the specific weight that ecology\nadds to the theory.597\nTo conclude, the elaboration of critical opinions against deep ecology copes mainly with\nthe mixture of its fundamentals, which drifts around academy and activism at the same time.\nThis duality gives the impression that the defence of the theory tends too much to simplicity.\nDesJardins recalls, for example, that Sessions merely discredits to the questionings affirming\nit deals with a misunderstood or misinterpreted view of the doctrine. Furthermore, it allows\ndefending scholar objections by means of activism, and vice versa, such as it occurs when\nsome commenters accuse deep ecologism of being too abstract or vague. In response, some\ndeep ecologists justify their arguments as rooted in the political activism of the movement.\nIndeed, political assertions often tend to blur the academic discourses.598\nIn any case, there is more than one observation against the theoretical postulates of deep\necology one can make. Firstly, misanthropy relating to the assertion of egalitarian\nbiocentrism seems to be the higher charge that deep ecologists have to combat. Indeed, the\nalluded function of the “ in principle ” clause does not appear to be enough to eschew the\naccusations of being a fascist stance against humanity, incapable of discerning between\nhuman and nonhuman interests.",

For example, it has happened with the affirmation of Abbey, the “ humanist”, who\naffirms his preference to kill humans instead of snakes. In a similar vein, Foreman, the “ ecowarrior”, has admitted that human suffering from drought and famine in Ethiopia is tragic.\nStill, he continues, the destruction of other beings and ecosystems is much more. Likewise,\nSessions himself mentions a couple of additional allegations of misanthropy, coming from\nMurray Bookchin and the former U.S. Vice President, Al Gore Jr., against some\npronouncements formulated by members of the activist movement Earth First! In particular,\nthey deal with its co-founder, [once again] Dave Foreman. Bookchin brings into question,\nfor example, the argument about AIDS as a valid mechanism of population control.599\nOn his part, Gore casts doubt on the logic of the metaphorical suggestion of eliminating\npeople “from the face of the earth ”, due to their inherent and contagious destructive nature.\nNonetheless, Sessions’ response does not go beyond affirming that it deals with a\nmisrepresentation of the doctrine, or that its critics’ arguments are “ strange and\nunsubstantiated ”. He even puts some distance between academic stances and the activists,\nadmitting that Earth First! movement had “[...] unfortunately made apparently misanthropic\nremarks which are antithetical to Deep Ecology philosophy ”, although one should say\nSessions does not really propound a robust reply against this objection.600\nAmong other responses, for example, McLaughlin assures that one should not interpret\nthe call for a gradual reduction of the population (lasting approximately thousand years, as\ninferred from Næss’ remarks) as a way of cruelty against humanity. He prefers to speak\nabout a mechanism to moderate the population growth to furnish a decent life for all beings.\nIn Ehrenfeld’s view instead, albeit an anti-humanism perspective is questionable, without\nprecluding the possibility of being true or untrue, it is even more questionable its utilisation\nas an excuse to delay the rejection of humanism (Sessions also alludes to this opinion). From\nall philosophers who have attempted to deny this accusation of fascism, Fox’s argument is\nprobably the most streamed, and it stems from a debate about ecofeminism. Indeed, the\nauthor contends that both ecofeminists and humanists tend to overlook the fact that “[t] he\ntarget of the deep ecologists’ critique is not humans per se [...] but rather human599 DesJardins ibid 219, 229; Sessions ibid xiii; Abbey (1971) 20; Foreman (1991) 26; Bookchin (1987) 16.\n600 Sessions ibid xiii; Gore (1992) 217.\ncenteredness ”, leading the issue to the realm of ideology, not philosophy. By the way, both\nSessions and Desjardins mention it.601\nNevertheless, despite all efforts to counter the allegations mentioned above, it seems the\ndeep ecologists have not been able to dispense with those questionings at all, or their\narguments are not convincing enough yet. As DesJardins appropriately suggests, it is\ndifficult to abandon the anthropocentric perspective in favour of the equality of values,\nwithout falling within misanthropic stances, and vice versa so that a substantial theoretical\ndevelopment still looks like a pendant task in this field.602\nThe second point of contention consists of the normative status of deep ecology. As part\nof an interpretive reading of Næss, in his work “ The World of Concrete Contents ”, Keller\ndefends the descriptive nature of the doctrine. He attributes to Næss the idea regarding deep\necology is “[...] simply an enumeration of general principles that command the assent of\npersons open to the direct apprehension of nature ”. Moreover, Keller points out that “ ecophenomenology ”, understood as “ unmitigated empiricism ”, has been useful to reinforce\nNæss’ belief concerning the promotion of direct experiences of Nature, i.e., what Næss has\nnamed its “ concrete contents ”. By the way, the notion of eco-phenomenology has been taken\nfrom Brown and Toadvine.603\nIn this regard, Næss does not come to affirm that his doctrine is essentially “ descriptive ”.\nNotwithstanding there are specific references to appearance and reality within his article,\nsuch as, for example, the assertion regarding how one can use the ecosystem concept to\n“describe” the abstract structures of science’s world. To him, deep ecology has definitively\nto do with those abstract structures. Næss even adduces that apparent and intrinsic\ndistinctions between subjects and objects cannot be generalised and described as concrete\ncontents of the world. Conversely, in “ The shallow and the deep... ”-he instead emphasises\nthat the principles of the Deep Ecology movement “[...] are clearly and forcefully\nnormative ”, as well as the social, political, and ethical material of ecosophy. Furthermore,\nreviewing the reference to deep ecology within the preparatory work of Brown and\nToadvine, one can notice a tendency to close the presumed gaps between phenomenology\nand ecology. Moreover, he looks “[...] for understanding the complex logics and boundary",

The best one among the ecocentric perspectives, it is worth\nsaying. Indeed, Leopold’s famous tract opens with a remembrance of Odysseus, coming\nback home after the Trojan War to hang a group of slave-girls for suspected misconduct.\nAfter all, “[t] he girls were [his] property ”, Leopold emphasises, and “[t] he disposal of\nproperty was then, as now, a matter of expediency, not of right and wrong ”. The simile\nappears evident, Nature is currently property, and its disposal is a matter of convenience, not\nof ethics. In Leopold’s words, “[l] and, like Odysseus' slave-girls, is still property.

By the way,\nLeopold’s conception of land is ecosystemic and corresponds to the current definition of\nNature, i.e., one should understand both expressions as synonyms in this particular case.605\nFrom this assumption, and as a result of following strictly the ethical sequence so\nskillfully proposed by Leopold, one cannot avoid deducing that transmutation of land/Nature\nfrom being an object toward being a subject is going to be the next step. In other words,\nLeopold encourages to change the status of Nature, from being property to being a fellowmember of the biotic community, grounded on the axiology of a “ value in the philosophical\nsense”, which is superior to the “ mere economic value ”.

Baird Callicott, the principal contemporaneous developer and advocate\nof the theory, published in 1980 a controversial interpretation of Leopold’s work. He started\nfrom the influential “ categorical imperative ” or “principal precept ”, as he calls it, of the\nland ethic, i.e., “ A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty\nof the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise ”, already and reiteratively\nquoted. Then, Callicott proposes that one should pay attention to “[...] the idea that the good\nof the biotic community is the ultimate measure of the moral value, the rightness or\nwrongness, of actions. ” Consequently, it would be ethically feasible and even\nrecommendable, for example, to hunt a white-tailed deer to keep the wholeness of the\necosystem safe and sound, evading the harmful effects of a cervid population explosion.607\nAs Salwén recalls, Callicott’s reasoning had [and still has] a strong dissonance within\ncertain philosophical circles, primarily among his detractors, and especially Tom Regan,\nwho even branded it as “ environmental fascism ”. To his academic adversaries, the\nLeopoldean principle has ethically unacceptable consequences. Freyfogle, for instance,\ninferred that it would be morally permissible “[...] if not obligatory, to reduce species\npopulations, humans included, when lower numbers are needed to uphold the healthy\nfunctioning of the community ”. In response, Callicott emphatically denied the presumed\ninhumane or anti-humanitarian character of Leopold’s stance, arguing that this kind of\nconclusion would contradict absurdly the theoretical foundations of the land ethic.608\nIn the main, Callicott advocates the extensionist character of the theory, pointing out\nthat the moral value of the biotic community does not replace the individual moral values.\nThus, there is no substitution but accretion to the several accumulated social ethics, just like\nit occurs, for instance, to people who do not lose their citizenship in a republic due to being\nalso residents of a municipality or family members. To support his argument, Callicott\nemploys the concept of Leopold’s biotic community, joint with another postulate coming\nfrom Mary Midgley , the conception of “mixed communities”.609",

Indeed, humans, plants (native and introduced ones) and any other living\nbeings are members of the biotic community, despite they pertain to their specific\ncommunities. Callicott’s hyperholism in itself constitutes the function of an ecological\ndescription of the biotic community, whose ethical version would be the “ biosocial moral\ntheory”, attributed to Leopold and Midgley altogether. Within the interaction of participants,\nthe author comments, the biosocial moral paradigm provides for several co-existing\ncooperating and competing ethics, where “[...] each corresponding to our nested\noverlapping community entanglements [...]”.614 The previous charts are illustrative thereon.\nCallicott’s conclusion concerning the fact that all animals and other living beings pertain\nto the biotic community, without ceasing to be part of others, either nested or mixed ones,\nphilosophically reinforces the principal postulates of the land ethic. Firstly, his argument\ndoes not only ratify but also pivots on Leopold’s idea concerning the existence of members\nwho are independent of their fellows and the community to which they belong. In Leopold’s\nwords, “[a] ll ethics so far evolved rest upon a single premise that the individual is a member\nof a community of interdependent parts ”. Secondly, Callicott emphasises the function of the\nbiosocial moral theory as a provider of a dichotomic atmosphere of competition and\ncooperation among the members of the social community. In other words, when Callicott\naffirms that individuals contend among them but, at the same time, they help each other, he\nis backing up the ecological conception of Leopold regarding that ethics constitute “[...] a\nlimitation on freedom of action in the struggle for existence ”.615\nIn essence, as one can notice, Callicott’s line of reasoning does not only contribute to\nenhancing the understanding of moral purview of the land ethic concerning the roles of living\nbeings and their positions in Nature.

Thus,\nalthough Regan had said that both visions are like water and oil, so they do not mix, one\ncannot deny that both perspectives seem to share common environmental concerns.616\nWithin this line of thought, as Keller argues, there is no way to certainly know whether\nthis suggestive defence of the land ethic throughout the overlapping communities is aimed\nonly at undermining the criticisms or also mitigating the initial extreme holism of the\ntheoretical posture. In either event, it turns out evident that Callicott is looking for a joint\nalignment against what he names as “ the destructive forces at work ravaging the nonhuman\nworld”.617 It would be preferable that environmental ethicists make common cause against\nthe contemporary ecological crisis than keep contending among them, sometimes due to\nsuperficial conceptual details.\nTo recapitulate, as explained by DesJardins, the charges of “ environmental fascism ” or\n“ethical totalitarian holism ” are pretty serious. Nonetheless, the model of “[...] concentric\ncircles in which our affections are extended first to self and family and later to broader\ncommunities ” seems to overrule the interpretation concerning the feasibility to reduce the\npopulation of species (including humans) if it is the better for the stability of the\ncommunity.618\nThe reason lies in the fact that overlapped communities foster the cooperation of\nsubsistence firstly within the smaller circles of morality; i.e., what Leopold calls the\n“limitation on freedom of action in the struggle for existence ”.

In a similar sense, Alan Marshal, a\nsceptical critic of Lovelock, has labelled the Gaian postulates as a “ technocentric\nembodiment ”. However, he has also recognised its enormous repercussion within the\ncurrents of thought that promote the modern tendencies toward the “ wholeness ”; or in his\nown words, “ the unity of nature ”. Nevertheless, the idea is not necessarily fresh, since one\nof its antecedents easily tracks in the older concept of the “ indivisibility of Earth ”, written\nhis death.628\nThe best evidence of the influence of Gaia-hypothesis, at present, consists of having\nachieved the incorporation of some its core features into the draft Universal Declaration of\nthe Rights of Mother Earth , promoted by the Bolivian government in 2010. It constitutes the\nonly updated document that encompasses the rights of Nature at a global level. From the\noutset, it establishes the living condition of the planet, when effectively reads: “ Mother Earth\nis a living being ”. Curiously, Gaia (also Gaea) means literally “ Mother Earth ”, the\nmythological primordial Greek goddess, mother of the Titans. Sagan and Margulis recount\nthe anecdote about how the celebrated novelist Willian Golding, Lovelock’s neighbour,\nsuggested the name “ Gaia” to him.629\nIn context, the head objection relative to Gaia hypothesis perhaps resides in the lack of\nconcurrence between the homeostatic autoregulation of the planet, which creates\npurposefully optimal conditions for life, and the evolution by natural selection. To Dawkins,\none of its critics, homeostasis is a typical activity of living organisms during their\ndevelopment, i.e., after a competition among individuals wherein the survivors are those\nwho have been more successful in transmitting their genes. Therefore, being Earth the only\nliving planet without rivals in the solar system, the development of its homeostasis would\nsound unrealistic.630\nIndeed, Margulis herself rejected the term “ organism ”, as a personification of the\nEarth’s surface. In both “Simbiotic Planet ” and “Acquiring Genomes ” (along with Sagan),\nshe made it clear that no organism is able to survive, by consuming its own wastes and\nbreathing its very gas excretions.

Sagan and Whiteside\ncomplemented the objection, remembering how Ford Doolittle ridiculed the idea about\nsearching for optimal conditions for life, as if it were a teleological system, suggesting a\n“secret consensus ” among microorganisms to determine their common interests.631\nIn response, Lovelock accepted having designed a computer simulation, termed\n“Dasiyworld ”, especially to answer his detractors, Doolittle and Dawkins, and demonstrated\nthat the world, weather, and environment are the result of an automatic, not teleological,\ngoal-seeking system. In addition, he admitted as evident that “[...] Earth was alive in the\nsense that it was a self-organizing and self-regulation system ”.632\nBeyond Lovelock’s response, the Gaia hypothesis has experienced a conceptual\ntransition from exclusive homeostasis towards autopoiesis, a definition created by biologists\nVarela and Maturana to describe self-production and maintenance of living beings. As Lyon\nasserts, autopoiesis consists of a “[...] continual production by a network of the very\ncomponents that comprise and sustain the network and its processes of production ”. The\ninterconnectedness between the living organism and its surroundings, anchored to\nautopoiesis, is fundamental for its very survival.

In this context, communion represents the interconnectedness\namong beings (“ subjects” in the words of Berry), in contrast to the notion of a simple\n“collection of objects ”. It evokes the symbolic link with the proposed legal transmutation of\nNature, from being an object towards being a subject of law. Likewise, although\ndifferentiation refers to the uniqueness of organisms, which could not live fragmented, the\nsole manner to sustain life on Earth consists of its integral functioning. Thus, Berry asserts\n“[...] earth is not a global sameness ”.635\nAs mentioned, autopoiesis relates to systems capable of producing and sustaining by\nthemselves. This idea is not rare above all if one thinks about plants as autotrophs or primary\nproducers and the photosynthesis, as the mechanism to synthesise their food. Lovelock and\nBerry’s coincidences turn around this ensemble of elements relative to the integral operation\nof Nature. Berry was thinking about Lovelock was one of the very few scientists concerned\nabout the functioning of living systems.636\nIn that regard, the draft Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth interestingly includes\nthe essential tenets of the Gaia hypothesis, when it reads: “ Mother Earth is a unique,\nindivisible, self-regulating community of interrelated beings that sustains, contains and\nreproduces all beings ”. It represents the idea about the wholeness of Nature, which one can\naddress through the notions of uniqueness and indivisibility, and somehow means\ndifferentiation as well. The community of interrelated beings illustrates the communion.\nLastly, autopoiesis appears in the insight of a self-regulating community that sustains and\nreproduces all beings.637",

The philosopher Thomas Berry\nled the conference, counting on the participation of lawyers and educators coming from\nCanada, Colombia, South Africa, and the U.S.A., whose expertise focused primarily on\nenvironmental issues and aboriginal cultures.638\nBefore passing to address the central premises of the Earth Jurisprudence, however, is\nworth clarifying that some authors often review Thomas Berry’s ethical thought as part of\nthe Ecotheology, as well. This clarification turns out of importance since the reader could\nquestion the present dissertation for negligence, by avoiding earlier defenders of the\nEcological Theology, such as Joseph Sittler, Lynn White Jr., Francis Schaeffer, Alfred North\nWhitehead, John Cobb, among others. One should also allude to the French Jesuit priest\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin, whose works decisively influenced Berry’s moral thought,\naccording to Lisa Sideris, but who is barely quoted by Berry within his seminal work\nconcerning Earth Jurisprudence.639 Moreover, although one should recognise the\nsignificance of Ecotheology and its promoters within environmental ethics, this subheading\nemphasises those stances concerning holistic hypothesis exclusively.\nIn this line of reasoning, one cannot preclude mentioning Pope Francis and his Laudato\nsi, above all considering it includes an explicit acknowledgement of Nature as valuable in\nitself before God’s eyes, and several arguments against the consequences of a tyrannical,\nmisguided, excessive or distorted anthropocentrism . Nevertheless, one does not elaborate\nmore on the analysis of this encyclical letter because it does not aim at promoting a holistic\nperspective. Additionally, natural resources are still discursively deemed as earth’s goods\nthat humans should use responsibly, which is a human-centred outline yet.640\nUndoubtedly, Berry is the founder of the Earth Jurisprudence and his celebrated “ The\nGreat Work ” also represents its foundational book. By and large, he proposes some\nconditions of equality within his “ Earth community ” that one can only understand them by\nfocusing on the role of each element of Nature as an intrinsic value. It, therefore, contradicts\nthe traditional belief coming from classic Aristotelian philosophy, where one sees natural\ncomponents as mere instrumental values subordinated to higher ends. Thus, the difference",

For\nexample, both doctrines coincide with seeing humans and nonhumans as members of the\ncommunity. Indeed, Berry recognises that the “[...] single integral community of the Earth\n[...] includes all its component members whether human or other than human ”. Likewise,\nthe human being, “[...] as every species, is bound by limits in relation to the other members\nof Earth community ”, more or less as it occurs in Leopold’s biotic community by means of\nthe “[...] ethical obligation on the part of the private owner [...]”. Cormac Cullinan , the\nother remarkable figure of the Earth Jurisprudence, attributes explicitly to Leopold and Berry\nthe “deep roots ” of the theory.642\nNow, if one can identify such an ensemble of commonalities between both perspectives,\nit begs the question of why one should address them separately. Initially, there are three main\nreasons to do it, concerning predominantly to the methodology employed at the present\nresearch. Firstly, the scope of Earth Jurisprudence refers factually to the philosophy of law,\nproperly speaking, rather than ethics or moral philosophy. Consequently, as Cullinan argues,\nEarth Jurisprudence is “[...] a philosophy of law and human governance that is based on\nthe idea that humans are only one part of a wider community of beings and that the welfare\nof each member of that community is dependent on the welfare of the Earth as a whole ”.643\nAs one could imagine, the present conception definitively encompasses quite accurately\nthe aims of the doctrines of Nature’s rights. In practice, Cullinan himself and other specialists\naffiliated to different adherent institutions to Earth Jurisprudence, such as GAIA Foundation\nor the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF), among others, have\nadvised various procedures relating to the application of legislative measures, mainly in\nAfrica and Latin America. In that regard, Peter Burdon, in his valuable “ Exploring Wild\nLaw”, has compiled numerous references thereon. Thus, it requires an examination in more\ndetail from a legal standpoint.644\nSecondly, albeit both Leopold and Berry draw almost the same holistic conclusions\nabout the idealistic functioning of earth/biotic community, both paths are methodologically",

Consequently, their respective analyses should be distinct, as well. In this sense,\nwhile Leopold emphasises a scientific discourse, built on Darwinian principles, to outline\nthe philosophical foundations and pedigree of the land ethics, Berry prefers a historical\nreconstruction of the current environmental crisis, “[...] to understand where we are and\nhow we got here ”.645\nTo Berry, the realisation of where humans are and how they arrived here is crucial\nbecause the relationship between earth and humanity is experiencing a decisive [almost\napocalyptic] moment, in which “[n] atural selection can no longer function as it has\nfunctioned in the past ”. The end of the Cenozoic Era is looming, and the planet will move\ntowards the Ecozoic Era, by means of a “[...] transition from a period of human devastation\nof the Earth to a period when humans would be present to the planet in a mutually beneficial\nmanner”.646\nThirdly, although the scholar adherents of both philosophical stances have found in the\nindigenous worldviews some moral elements to support their respective premises, they do\nnot influence Land Ethic and Earth Jurisprudence with the same theoretical or empirical\nintensity. Therefore, one should observe these references seem to be more explicit in Berry’s\nwork than in Leopold’s.\nEffectively, there is only one express reference to native Indians in Leopold’s essay,\n“The Land Ethic ”, which has to do with the struggles for the control of the settlements of\nMississippi against the French and English traders and the American settlers. Leopold briefly\nmuses on the questions, coming from historians, concerning the effects upon cane-lands,\nderived from activities of cattle raising, ploughing, burning, and deforestation. He does not\nelaborate on any examination about the ethical perspectives of native peoples.647 Instead,\nCallicott is who sees the shared points between American Indian cosmology and the land\nethic.

    "text": "For Thomas Berry, instead, the wisdom of the indigenous peoples possesses momentous\nimportance. It constitutes one of the four pivots that will guide humanity into the future. The\nother pillars are the wisdom of women, classical traditions, and science. Following a\nhistorical method, as his principal tool of analysis, Berry highlights the role of these wisdom\ntraditions as supporters of the forthcoming era, within the ambit of the interplay between\nhumans and Nature. In context, one could read a moral connotation concerning human\nbehaviour towards the natural world, which would orient to a mutual enhancement of their\npresence on Earth.649\nIndigenous wisdom, Berry states, “[...] is distinguished by its intimacy with and\nparticipation in the functioning of the natural world ”, which to some extent reaches a\nmetaethical scope, spiritual, as it were. For example, the cosmogony of native people\nregarding the sequence of sunrise and sunset reveals an unusual sensitivity, to the point of\nconstituting a “ pattern of life ”, a “great liturgy ”, or a “celebration of existence ”. Berry\nrejoices at the fluorescence and colour of flowers or the beauty of birds’ songs as a reflection\nof the indigenous worldview. Likewise, he evokes the capacity of adaptation of early\nhumans, discovering new sources of food and shelter, expressing new signs of culture,\nthrough rituals, chants, arts and other customs, developed mainly during the Palaeolithic, or\ncontinuously enhancing their systems of communication. In sum, he fosters the role of\nindigenous people in terms of previous experience to guide current and incoming\ngenerations. In his words: “ As the years pass it becomes ever more clear that dialogue with\nnative peoples here and throughout the world is urgently needed to provide the human\ncommunity with models of a more integral human presence to the Earth ”.650\nAs a complement, Cullinan confirms the roots of Earth Jurisprudence lies at the\ncosmologies and customary practices of many native peoples coming from Africa, India, and\nother countries.651 At present, native worldviews and ancient traditions have entailed a\nresurgence, influencing the modernity of law, and being particularly successful in the cases",

    "text": "To recapitulate, Berry believed the environmental problems were primarily of what he\nlabelled as “ macrophase biology ”. Macrophase biology comprises “[...] the integral\nfunctioning of the entire complex of biosystems of the planet [...]”, and concerns five\nessential spheres: land, water, air, life, and the human mind. To him, the interplay between\nthe human mind and the other elements is crucial to understand the nature of the\nenvironmental crisis, because although all living beings possess consciousness, it is different\nin humans, animals, and plants. It does not mean the human consciousness is better or\nsuperior to the others’ ones. It is just distinct. As an example, Berry states that, for fish’s\npurposes, “[...] human modes of consciousness would be more a defect than an\nadvantage ”.653 In context, it seems he subtly holds the ecological problem comes historically\nfrom humans (mind), not from the rest of living beings, who seem to adapt to the milieu.\nIn this regard, the only manner to overcome the environmental crisis consists of a change\nof biological period, i.e., from the Cenozoic to the Ecozoic era . However, according to Berry,\nhumans have to previously meet some conditions for the emergence of the new stage: (1) to\nunderstand that the universe is a communion of subjects, not a collection of objects, (2) to\nrealise that the Earth exists, and can survive, only in its integral functioning, (3) to recognise\nthat the Earth is a one-time endowment, (4) to realise that the Earth is primary and humans\nare derivative, (5) to realise that there is a single Earth community, (6) to understand fully\nand respond effectively to the very human role in this new era, and (7) to establish a",

As one can notice, these conditions seem to brief the overall principles of\necocentrism.654\nIn particular, the communion of subjects evokes the symbolic link with the proposed\nlegal transmutation of Nature, from being an object towards being a subject of law. For this\nreason, the adaptability of this theory to the postulates of Nature’s rights facilitates the moral\nsupport that the recognition of the international legal personality of Nature would require in\npractice, and not only the endowment of specific rights. Moreover, there is a real possibility\nto personalise Nature through the idea concerning a single Earth community. This\ncommunity does not prevent the individualisation of its members due to its integral function.\nIndeed, although differentiation refers to the uniqueness of organisms, which could not live\nfragmented, the sole manner to sustain life on Earth precisely consists of its integral\nfunctioning. That is why Berry asserts “[...] earth is not a global sameness ”.655 In sum, as\nLeopold thought, Earth is a community formed by its parts, and all of them possess their\nindividuality.\nLastly, Vandana Shiva is an Indian philosopher to whom several authors, such as Gruen\nor Koons, attributes the notion of Earth Democracy , understood as a set of social practices,\nmovements, and actions towards living politics, cultures, and economies. Nevertheless, the\nfact that one can pigeonhole her ethical stances into the Earth Jurisprudence is undoubtedly\ndue to the explicit allusions coming from Cullinan and Berry himself. From her first book,\n“Staying Alive ” of 1988, she already addressed the theme of rights of specific ecosystems.\nThus, although the work refers to issues concerning ecofeminism, she dedicated one section\nto analyse the need for respecting the rights of the soil.656 Some years later, she unfolded the\nscope of Earth Democracy.

    "text": "There were four hypotheses posed at the beginning of this chapter. The first one consisted\nof finding out if the traditional human-centred principles were enough to provide the\nethical foundations for the recognition of international legal personhood to Nature . In this\nregard, after a review of the core premises of traditional ethics, one could corroborate that\nthe process of expansion of the borders of morality exclusively occurs among human beings,\nfrom the anthropocentric standpoint.\nConsequently, traditional ethics rejects any living being or entity positioned outside the\nambit of the human sphere. Within a hierarchical understanding of life, were people occupy\na preeminent place over any natural element or Nature itself, it would be unthinkable to\nconsider non-human moral agents as equals to persons.\nMoreover, one of the principal reasons to reject the possibility of acknowledging Nature\nas a legal person in general (international one in particular) refers to its juridical status.\nEffectively, from an anthropocentric perspective, natural resources make up a set of goods,\neven commodities, able to deliver food, clothes, shelter, and other services for human\nwelfare. In other words, anthropocentric ethics appear so unquestionable because they\nprecisely correspond to and fit well with an early, modern, and contemporary production of\ncommodities and provision of services, coming from the different stages of capitalism.\nAccordingly, from this outlook, the right to a healthy environment perhaps emerges as\nthe perfect legal mechanism to warranty ecological protection. It does not imply a defence\nof the rights of Nature in itself but rather a way to guard the rights of people, their rights to\nhave a sound, general satisfactory, safe, clean, or a healthy environment. So, Nature\nconstitutes a thing, not a person.\nThe second hypothesis involved the query concerning what the moral considerability\nof Nature is, according to the principles of environmental ethics . In this regard, as an initial",

    "text": "657 Shiva (2005) 1, 5, 62, 83\nstep, one should divide the response into two approaches: an individualistic and another\nholistic.\nAs mentioned, the individualistic ethicists depict a different range of stances, which\ngoes from the restricted recognition of specific species of animals, such as the higher\nmammals, to the broadest acknowledgement of all life, such as it happens in the egalitarian\nbiocentrism. In effect, the psychocentrism of Singer and Regan, barely differentiated by\nspecificities of ethical scope, restricts the moral considerability of natural elements\nexclusively to those mammals capable of feeling pain and pleasure or being mentally aware\nof their surroundings, respectively. On his part, through his teleological centres of life,\nTaylor has opened the purview of moral status to the totality of living beings on the planet.\nIn parenthesis, it is worth clarifying the mentioned ethical doctrines are not the only ones\npromoting biocentric perspectives to address the environmental issues. They are merely\nexamples of two doctrinal positions of the extremes, useful to illustrate the variety of scholar\nproposals.\nConcerning the possibility to support the international legal personality of Nature\nthroughout any of these theoretical postures, one should warn there are, at least, three main\nhindrances. On the one hand, the biocentric perspectives avoid extending the limits of the\nmoral circle towards inanimate elements of Nature, such as air, water, and soil. This lack of\nrecognition sets aside the possibility of granting moral considerability to ecosystems, which\nwould mean a distortion for the application of rights of Nature in practice.\nOn the other hand, the general premises of psychocentrism impose a too-rigid restriction\non the moral considerability of the natural world. The doctrines of animal liberation and\nrights, in particular, exclude a significant group of species, reducing, even more, the\nspectrum of moral and legal recognition of Nature.\nInstead, the egalitarian biocentrism seems to be too flexible, by acknowledging the\nmoral considerability of all living beings. If the sole condition to deserve moral standing is\nlife, it would bring about an ontological struggle for morality between complete organisms\n(e.g., humans, plants or animals) and other microorganisms, which are often parts of them\n(e.g., virus, bacteria or archaea).\nAnother unwanted implication evokes the past judgements of animals, which has been\nentirely inconvenient for the development of law, as mentioned. An uncontrolled unfold of\nthese theories could bring about a mere aesthetic transfiguration of animals from being\nhistorically defendants to being plaintiffs before contemporary courts.\nThe holistic approach concerning the moral considerability of Nature also contributes\nto answering the third ethical research question of this chapter, i.e., how feasible the\nenlargement of moral limits toward Nature would be . Initially, one has to discard those\npositions associated with the so-called weak holism. The main reason to reject the doctrine\nlies in the hierarchical structure of values, which places once again to humans in a\nsupervisory position over the natural world. Although the authors bestow moral importance\non Nature and its components, it would be hard to claim equity of conditions with respect to\nhumans in the international arena or before the system of justice.\nOn its part, the principles of deep ecology are neither enough to support the potential\ngranting of rights to Nature ethically. Indeed, although one should admit this moral stance\nis the most comprehensive one among the biocentric trends, it lacks the recognition of abiotic\nelements of Nature. This deficiency of scope derives in an irremediable hindrance to\nconsider the legal personhood of ecosystems.\nIn this line of analysis, although Gaia-hypothesis adapts better to the granting of moral\npersonality to Nature, above all considering the personification of the planet, it has been said\nit deals with a scientific approach more than an ethical posture. Consequently, it is useful as\na reference but not as a moral foundation of the legal system.\nTo conclude, both the land ethic and the earth jurisprudence describe the interplay\nbetween humans and Nature symmetrically, so to speak, that is, there is a biotic/earth\ncommunity formed by members who play a specific role and possess particular entitlements.\nTheir actions respond to moral restrictions that allow others the exercise of their very rights.\nThe welfare of the community is the principal aim, while the wellbeing of its members turns\nout ancillary and functional to the benefit of the whole.\nIn sum, it proves hard to avoid a simile with the international community, where every\nsingle country possesses legal personality, which is different from their citizens’. The moral\ndepictions designed by both Leopold and Berry are definitively the best allegories to promote\nthe bestowment of legal personality on Nature, from an ethical standpoint. In addition, this\naffirmation constitutes the response to the fourth hypothesis as well. Thus, the central\nfoundations of ethics with which the holistic perspective would contribute to enhancing\nthe interplay between humans and Nature are the land ethic and the earth jurisprudence.",

Likewise, it encompasses the scrutiny\nof the main implications derived from the change of lawful condition.\nAs reiteratively mentioned, the ambit of study corresponds to the international arena,\nconsidering that Nature or any other ecosystem does not constitute an individualistic entity,\nbut rather a holistic one, whose extension could involve more than one national territory.\nFurthermore, even when the ecosystem does not possess transboundary limits, there is a\nlatent possibility to be part of disputes before international courts of justice, as explained in\nthe chapter four. In any case, the representation of Nature has arisen as a need of momentous\nimportance, in order to defend the natural interests at continuous stake.\nIn that regard, the primary sources of those legal requirements will be the national\nexperiences coming from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, India, New Zealand, and the United\nStates of America, in matters of legislation and justice. The reason lies in the fact that those\nnational legal frameworks are currently in operation and whose results can be already subject\nof analysis because of their advanced implementations.\nAdditionally, one cannot discard the secondary sources of information, comprised of the\nexisting scholar developments.

Therefore, the incidence of the theories and\nhypothesis coming from the promoters and defenders of rights of Nature turns out\nundeniable, at least, over those nations.\nLikewise, the scrutiny of the flaws concerning the international legal framework and the\nsystem of justice, elaborated in the previous chapters, will be of importance to describe the\nlegal implications derived from the potential recognition of Nature as a legal person and a\nholder of rights.\nNow, to ease its discursive contents, this chapter will be guided by a series of research\nquestions, as follows:",

    "text": "To contextualise, if one makes do with a peripheral vision about the idea of the recognition\nof rights of Nature, one takes the risk to think it deals merely with “[...] imaginative legal\ninnovations and prescriptions for radical social transformation beyond present institutional\nor legal scope ”.658 In other words, it would consist of a “ useless juridical endeavour ”, so to\nspeak. Nevertheless, a revision in detail of erstwhile records will permit to discover these\nproposals are not only contemporary novelties to face the environmental crisis, but rather\nlawful concerns, whose historical roots could be found even in the Renaissance.\nFor example, one of the ancient antecedents is “[...] the right of the insects to adequate\nmeans of subsistence suited to their nature ”, a right recognised as a result of a sixteenthcentury court proceeding, instituted against a swarm of weevils under the accusation of\nhaving plundered the vineyards of the city of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, in France.\nInterestingly, beyond the appropriateness of legal reasoning, the nature of beetles demanded\nto think about the community instead of individuals, namely the judges had to prioritise the\nswarms instead of each insect, which somehow represents the essence of the ecocentric\ndoctrine. Nonetheless, swarms were not the only case. Evans remembers that, at the time,\npractitioners were perfectly aware that natural laws governed the protection of general\nwelfare among animals living in communities, i.e., herds, flocks or swarms, which punished\ncorporally or capitally any potential attack coming from their members.659",

Nevertheless, this time the author referred to the existence of a\n“community at large ”, wherein humans and animals inhabit together, an aspect that certainly\ndraws near to the ecocentric doctrines in theoretical terms. In principle, the idea does not\nseem complicated because the animals are not individually entitled to anything. They are\njust things. However, the argument turns increasingly obscure when Salmond asserts that\nanimals could be holders of specific rights as fellows of the community, referring\nspecifically to “ particular classes of animals ”.

This Salmond’s work is quite probably one of the most remote antecedents of\nSax’s idea to apply the public trust doctrine to natural resources. Therefore, animals have\nthe right to be part of that trust. To Salmond, both duties and rights do not really correspond\nto animals, but to the society in itself. If one reads between the lines, however, Salmond\nlooks like a fervent believer of animal rights, to the point that he comes to enquire himself\nif animals could really be holders of rights and have legal personality. He immediately\ndismisses the possibility, mainly because he considers from the outset they are “[...] merely\nthings-often the objects of legal rights and duties, but never the subjects of them ”, according\nto the Western traditional principles that guide all his parlance.661\nCuriously, his will to recognise animal rights is so strong that he ends up including them\ninto the society to attain this goal. In his words: “ These duties towards animals are conceived\nby the law as duties towards society itself. They correspond not to private rights vested in\nthe immediate beneficiaries, but to public rights vested in the community at large - for the\ncommunity has a rightful interest, legally recognized to this extent, in the well-being even of\nthe dumb animals which belong to it ”. Moreover, his arguments are transcendent to the\ndoctrines of Nature’s rights because they became one of the juridical sources, utilised by the\nIndian High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital, in the conferment of legal personality to the\nrivers Ganga and Yamuna, and the glaciers Gangotri and Yamunotri.662\nAnother important author to mention is Clarence Morris . He is responsible for the first\nmodern explicit allusion to Nature as a subject of law, which appeared in a curious 1964essay, prepared apropos of a landscape architecture lesson. At first glance, a couple of\ninteresting facts should be emphasised. On the one hand, Morris was quite probably the first\nauthor who gave a name to that human-centred approach seen as a threat to Nature; but he\nemployed the expression “ homocentric ”, which never came to popularise to the same extent\nthat the term “ anthropocentric ” did. Nelson and Ryan attribute the first academic use of the\nexpression “anthropocentric” to Lynn White Jr. in 1967. On the other hand, one of the key",

Morris upholds that “[s] ome of the costs fall\non brutes and things, worth protecting for themselves as well as for their use to men ”.663\nDuring the early seventies, some inspiring releases sprang from different sources than\nlegal ones, i.e., from activism, journalism, and education. Roderick Nash counts on a quite\ncomplete compilation. Thus, the activist Joan McIntyre wrote in 1971 a book chapter\npropounding a bill of rights for wildlife, whose importance lies mainly in the fact that it\npragmatically supports the global insight, addressed previously by Morris. McIntyre\nsuggested that “[...] any meaningful legislative program must be constructed on a new\nmorality, must be directed at achieving a Bill of Rights for all wild creatures, everywhere ”.\nThe use of the adjective “all” and the adverb “everywhere” represents the cohesive character\nof his proposal, what is doubtlessly confirmed when the author quotes Leopold, to whom he\nseems to know beforehand.664\nA second source came from a 1971 chronicle about the “ First Constitutional Convention\nto recognize the existence and rights of the Great Family ”, prepared by Harold Gilliam , a\nnewspaperman from the San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle. Nash quoted the event and\nits contents as “ An Equinoctial Ceremony in a Nob Hill Cathedral ”. According to Gilliam,\nthe meeting aimed at asking “[...] how the Bill of Rights might be rewritten by the national\nbicentennial in 1976 to affirm not only the rights of man but the rights of all living things-\nmembers of the Great Family ”. Beyond this assertion, there is no more specific information\nabout the contents of such a convention, so that it would not be adequate to comment it in\ndeep.665\nAlthough his views concerning the interplay between rights and environment could turn\nout indecipherable due to the lack of information, one could infer Gilliam somehow believed\nin the rights of Nature. The context of the three questions the author posed immediately after\nthe quoted statement about the gathering’s aim seems to confirm this assertion, that is, he\nwonders: “ What are the rights of a pelican? A redwood? A stream? ”666 To elucidate his\nopinion would be necessary to segregate his twofold facet, discarding the scathing journalist",

Thus, from a broad overview, one can\nobserve that Gilliam continuously oriented his discourse towards the maintenance of a\nbalanced relationship between humans and Nature, public and private interests, and even\ncurrent and future generations. These ideas, recurrent within his texts, are precisely the\nstarting point to infer he champions somehow the position about rights of Nature, above all\nwhen he asserts that “ Every species, including Homo sapiens, must live in balance with its\nnatural environment ”.668\nFor Gilliam, “[...] the fate of wildlife reflects the inconsistencies of man ”, who firstly\ndestroys the species and later, feeling regretful, strives to save the survivors. It provokes an\nimpasse, he states, a “[...] conflict concerned a deadly serious matter: the relation of man\nto his environment, particularly to the community of plants and animals to which he\nbelongs”. Summing up, although one can perceive an anthropocentric root in his statements,\nGilliam sees a natural community integrated by humans as well. Thus, he becomes as one of\nthe genuine pragmatic forerunners. For example, the author upholds that “ There is a point\nat which the conquest of nature becomes overkill. At that point man jeopardizes his own lifesupport system ”.669\nFinally, the last no legal allusion refers to an educational researcher, Thomas Colwell\nJr., whose academic interests have been robustly relating to ecological education since the\nend of the sixties, emphasising precisely the recurrent idea about [hu]man as part of\nNature.670 To him, humans belong to a “ natural community ”, understood as a wholeness of\ndiverse elements, where both a struggle for resources to live and a law of ecology that",

Effectively, as an educator, Colwell believes firmly\n“[w]hat a genuine environmental education needs to do above all is to foster a recognition\nof the full implications of the simple and oft-repeated truth that man is part of Nature ”.671\nMoreover, his primary ethical source is John Dewey himself, the celebrated philosopher\nto whom several authors (e.g., Legg and Hookway) attribute to be one of the founders of\npragmatism, along with Charles Sanders Peirce and William James. Considering certain\naspects concerning holism, Colwell devoted a book review about some commentators of\nDewey’s works, focusing mainly on how Dewey addresses the relationship between humans\nand Nature, but also highlighting the notion about humans as part of the environment,\nassumed as a biological organism. McDonald has developed a quite thorough analysis of\nDewey’s holism.672\nIn 1971, Earl Murphy wrote a somehow obscure essay [by the way considering this\nresearch focus], “ Has Nature Any Right to Life? ”, mainly aimed at contrasting the different\ndimensions between the urban areas and the countryside. Within the text, one can find a\nsomehow holistic idea. The assertion reads: “ If ends are influenced by intermediate\nprocedures, there seems to be forming out of nature a kind of entelechy implying a term to\nall things”. One should concur with Nash, however, about the fact that “[...] the title is more\nprovocative than the text ”.673\nReviewing Roderick Nash’s compilation, one can notice the inclusion of two additional\nsources within the context of what he calls the “ anticipation of Stone’s inquiry ”. At first\nsight, given that both are quoted immediately after the reference about Murphy, one would\ntend to think they are also useful to support the ideas about rights of Nature. Nonetheless,\nafter a brief examination, one can conclude that none constitutes a valid reference. It\ntranspires that Nash included them because these works denoted reflections about\n“environmental rights ”, but the author himself seems to dismiss them.674\nThus, Atkinson’s doctoral dissertation, Nash comments, “[...] examines human rights\nto, rather than the rights of, nature”, what entails that it is not an accurate source to support",

    "text": "Professor Christopher Stone quite probably constitutes the most connoted philosopher of law\nin the ambit of Nature’s rights and his celebrated “ Should trees have standing? ” represents\nthe cornerstone. His most remarkable contribution maybe consists of proposing that\nunthinkable in terms of rights becomes thinkable in practice.\nIn 1972, Christopher Stone explicitly wrote that he was quite seriously proposing “[...]\nto give legal rights to forest, oceans, rivers and other so-called ‘natural objects’ in the\nenvironment-indeed, to the natural environment as a whole”. His reasoning was intensely\nsupported on the extension of rights towards “ natural life ”, as it had historically happened\nwith new bearers before the law, such as children, women, blacks, Indians, foetuses, among\nothers. As Stone himself recognised it, the bestowal of legal standing on the “ natural\nenvironment ” occurred to him on the merits of the famous case Sierra Club v. Morton , while\nthe appeal was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. His argument aimed at backing up\nthe claimant’s allegation against the lack of right to sue, adduced by the defendant.676\nAlthough one can trace the case’s roots in 1965, the controversy actually started in 1969,\nwhen the U.S. Forest Service granted a 30-year permit to Walt Disney Productions, Inc. to\nconstruct a complex and a ski-resort on eighty acres of Mineral King Valley. The area was\nlocated in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, adjacent to Sequoia National Park. The whole\nproject comprised of installations for lodging, food, swimming, parking, and transportation,\namong other facilities. In addition, investors expected to build a 20-mile high-speed road\nand a 66-kilovolt power line, counting already on the approvals issued by the Department of\nthe Interior.677\nInitially, Sierra Club-a non-profit organisation founded by the conservationist John\nMuir in 1892-filed a suit, arguing “[...] a special interest in the conservation and the sound",

The\nimmediate result was successful, given that the Federal District Court awarded a preliminary\ninjunction, grounded on possible “[...] excess of statutory authority, sufficiently substantial\nand serious to justify [...]” it, and rejected the respondents' allegation with regard to the\nclub’s right to sue.678\nNevertheless, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the previous judgement,\nreasoning that Sierra Club was not the proper plaintiff because their members did not allege\nany affectation, which somehow could financially harm or jeopardise them. Besides, the\ntribunal argued that the general interest in conservation was not enough “[...] to challenge\nthe exercise of responsibilities on behalf of all the citizens by two cabinet level officials of\nthe government acting under Congressional and Constitutional authority ”. Finally, the U.S.\nSupreme Court upheld the Ninth Circuit’s judgement in April 1972, affirming that nobody\ncan invoke a mere “ interest in a problem ” by itself as the starting point of litigation. If it\nwould occur, the Court would not be able to refuse future lawsuits, brought purely predicated\non good faith and “ special interest ”.679\nDespite this adverse decision, the whole process has always been seen as positive by\nSierra Club members, maybe not only due to the fact that Disney World Productions never\nbuilt the project, but essentially because U.S. authorities annexed Mineral King Valley into\nSequoia National Park in 1978.680\nWithin the Court’s reasoning, there are two key issues to address in Sierra Club v.\nMorton, as requirements to legal standing. They are the judicial representation and the\neconomic sense of Nature’s rights. Thus, on the one hand, Professor Stone profoundly\nanalysed the legal obstacles to represent natural objects, and especially wilderness areas,\nbefore courts, being aware of the importance of juridical actions to promote their\nconservation. The author suggested handling a guardianship in the same way one can use it\nto represent incompetent people or corporations in their lawful businesses or even real\nestates. In other words, the proposal deals with the appointment of a guardian (could be “ ad\nlitem”), a conservator or setting up a committee, as appropriate.681\nThirteen years later, Stone continued to wonder, “[...] if standing were the barrier, why\nnot designate Mineral King, the wilderness area itself, as the plaintiff ‘suffering legal",

In\nthis regard, when the U.S. courts define what one should understand as injury, it is\nunavoidable to identify an economic connotation. As one will notice, whatever the label the\njudges use in environmental judgements, either concrete and particularised injury, special\ninterest, personal rights, and so forth, the approach of the proceedings does not usually focus\non the environment. The courts often zero in on the litigants, especially the claimants, and\nthe idea of a “ concrete injury ” does not leave room for anything than something measurable\nin monetary terms. In a similar vein, when the courts refer to “ redressable ” injuries, the\neconomic connotation becomes even stronger. Otherwise, money is not abstract.\nTherefore, beyond the final result of the adjudications, the American courts’ criteria\nhave focused on considering the concrete and particularised injury of the petitioners instead\nof the environment’s, as one of the requirements of legal standing.683 In a celebrated 2000case, between Friends of Earth and Laidlaw Environmental Services, the U.S. Supreme\nCourt stated that “ The relevant showing for Article III standing is not injury to the\nenvironment but injury to the plaintiff ”. Moreover, the court asserted that the insistence on\necological damages solely implies a higher hindrance than necessary on the merits of the\nenvironmental permit enforcement. The Supreme Court referred to a National Pollutant\nDischarge Elimination System (NPDES) permit granted to Laidlaw by the South Carolina\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control.684\nLikewise, in a recent case of 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nreversed the certified orders coming from the district court due to lack of standing. In brief,\na group of sixteen minor claimants, represented by their respective legal guardians, five adult\nones, a non-profit organisation ( Earth Guardians ), and the future generations, represented\nby the criminologist James Hansen, brought a suit against the American federal government\nand some other public officials for the injuries caused by permitting, authorising and\nsubsidising fossil fuels. Their claim included psychological harm, impairment of recreational",

But even assuming that it is, the plaintiffs do not\nsurmount the remaining hurdle-establishing that the specific relief they seek is within the\npower of an Article III court. ”, among other reasons. According to the Court of Appeals, the\nremedial plan [i.e., a non-economic response to the injury, by the way] that petitioners\nrequested is out of its ambit of action. It also requires the intervention of the executive and\nlegislative branches. Thus, the court could not order, design, supervise, or implement it.687\nIn conclusion, American courts have employed the concept of “ injury in fact ” to\ndetermine both the legal representation of Nature before courts and the economic\nconnotation of the compensation for injuries. If the litigant does not attain to demonstrate\nthe concrete and particularised injury, there will be a lack of legal standing to bring a lawsuit.\nBut, additionally, if the injury is not measurable in monetary terms, the claim will not either\nbe successful. In Sierra Club v. Morton, the Court explicitly argued:",

    "text": "In contradistinction to the anthropocentric view of the courts, Professor Stone proposes\na quite different but understandable reasoning from the point of view of ecocentrism.\nLawyers have performed their professional activities among inanimate right-holders, he\nstated, such as trusts, corporations, joint ventures, municipalities, nation-states, and so on.\nTo a certain extent, although he does not do it explicitly, Stone seems to wonder how it is\npossible than humans have recognised the [even constitutional] rights of ships and banks,\nwhich constitute inanimate objects, and they cannot acknowledge the rights of Nature and\nits components, as it were, which are living beings. The questioning seems pretty simple but\nit possesses a consistent philosophical and legal profundity in practice.689\nEffectively, if one scrutinises the logic of Stone’s proposition, one should wonder what\nthe legal difference between a corporation and an ecosystem would be in practice. Why do\nlegislations worldwide recognise only rights for the former but no for the latter?\nCorporations are even the archetype of what laws define as “ fictitious or artificial\npersons”;690 i.e., these entities do not even exist in reality. Instead, although an ecosystem\ncould include inanimate objects (e.g., rocks, soils, or minerals), it certainly constitutes the\nhabitat of living beings, who are part of it, that is, while a corporation is a mere entelechy,\nwithout material substance and intangible, which one could only visualise through a set of\nlegal documents, an ecosystem is quite the opposite, its existence is real, material, tangible.\nThen, the only difference between corporations and ecosystems concerning their legal\nstatus is what the law establishes. The conferral of legal personhood to corporations was a\nneed for human sake in a particular moment of the history and lawmakers just did it. At\npresent, the recognition of legal personality in favour of ecosystems could imply a valid\nalternative for their protection, and humanity’s survival by the way, so the bestowal of\njuridical considerations does not seem to be a bad idea.",

Morton (1972) § III, 734-5 emphasis added.\n689 Stone (1972) 459-3.\n690 Gifis (2003) 313; Garner (2004) 3619.\nFrom the outset, human beings have created corporations for their benefit. As John\nDewey argued, the fiction doctrine concerning the personality of corporate bodies, or\nuniversitates , whose origin can be traced to Pope Innocent IV, “[...] was stated as the reason\nwhy an ecclesiastic collegium or universitas, or capitulum could not be excommunicated, or\nbe guilty of a delict ”. Thus, ecclesiastic authorities created corporate bodies to carry out a\nspecific function for accomplishing their objectives. Nowadays, although they possess other\nends, corporations fulfil their respective goals, but continue to be useful to humans. In plain\nlanguage, it does not matter the category of the corporation, i.e., non-profit, public or\nmunicipal, professional, and business ones, following the classification proposed by Mayer\nand others, they will often tend to ease the legal relationships and look for the human sake.691\nTherefore, it turns out extremely difficult to justify the bestowal of legal personality on\ncorporations and other similar entities, while at the same time legislations deny this\npossibility to ecosystems. Furthermore, this idea becomes incomprehensible when one\nthinks about the importance of ecosystems for the survival of people on Earth.\nIn this framework, to Professor Stone, legal rights have traced a path of evolution\nparallel to morality, i.e., by extending its borders towards an increasing number of subjects,\nto whom Stone labels as “ holder of legal rights ”. Indeed, he begins his distinguished article,\n“Should trees have standing? ” through this comparison. At this point, it proves inevitable to\nfind a characteristic in common with Leopold, Callicott, and their Land Ethic, the direct\nreference to the Darwinian explanation of “ social instincts and sympathies ” as a sort of\ncatalyser of this extension of rights and the human advances in civilisation.692\nTo be a right-holder, according to Stone, it is necessary to accomplish four requirements,\ni.e., (1) recognition of legal standing by an authority, (2) capacity to bring lawsuits before\nthe system of justice by itself, (3) acknowledgement of legal remedies derived from legal\nrelief of natural objects, and (4) benefits of legal relief applied directly on Nature.693\nFirstly, the recognition as a holder of rights coming from a legal authority seems to\ncomprise of the conferment of legal personhood. Still, this possibility did not appear\nexplicitly in his 1972-essay. It is rather in his following work thereon in which he refers\nexpressly to what he calls “ legal considerateness ” or “legal personification ” of certain\n“Unorthodox Entities (UEs) ” to whom he labels as “ Disinteresteds (Ds)”.

Consequently,\nit is not rare that Stone includes into this group a range “[...] from natural persons of\n‘special’ sorts, infants, lunatics, the unborn, slaves, and so on, to such nonhumans as\nanimals, species, the dead, and various sorts of corporations: nations, municipalities,\nbusiness organizations, and universities ”.695\nAs DesJardins observes, Stone’s conception of moral considerability [and legal\nconsiderateness696] grounds on the “ principle of interest”, a theoretical structure constructed\nin the function of the rights, and attributed to one of the most reputable philosophers, Joel\nFeinberg, and developed later also by Peter Singer. In an overall sense, Feinberg claims that\n“[...] the sorts of beings who can have rights are precisely those who have (or can have)\ninterests”. To him, a being who does not have any interest in being profited, avoiding\ninjuries, or having behalf to act in and no sake to act for cannot have rights.697\nNotwithstanding, contrary to what one could believe, taking for granted the association\nof Feinberg and Singer with sentientism, Christopher Stone does not promote animal rights\nor liberation, or any other premise related to psychocentrism. His notion of “interest”\ninterestingly lies rather in the letter of the law, i.e., the legal framework defines what one\nshould understand of “ interest”. “Legal interests and legal harms are what the law says they\nare”, he argues. If one carefully ponders on the possibility that an interest springs from the\nlaw instead of conscience, sentiment, or feeling, however, the idea could even sound absurd.\nStone was entirely conscious of the potential criticisms, to the point of admitting that the\nlegal status bestowed on any river, for example, does not necessarily imply a better or worse\ncondition to the ecosystem. “ The implication, our critic will claim, is that any apparent\nconflict involving rivers is illusory ”, he affirmed.698 Over time, nevertheless, one has been",

Therefore, he proposes the notion of the\n“Disinteresteds (Ds)”, i.e., entities without interests, whose epitome or example par\nexcellence is the “ river”. Throughout the essay, one can find other ecosystems, such as soils,\nlakes, mountains, forests, marshes, brooks, and beaches, among others. Indeed, there is an\nexplicit reference to Leopold and Land Ethic concerning the functional context of the\nconception of soils for life. Yet, the legal analysis is not solely circumscribed by the\necosystemic field. Professor Stone also reviews the cases of robots, embryos, tribes, species,\nfuture generations, and artefacts.699 Consequently, it does not appear difficult to deduce the\nlegal proposal. If there are some entities without interests, whose welfare constitutes an\ninterest for the Contemporary Normal Proximate Persons , as it were, then the law will\ndetermine their interest.\nSecondly, as far as the capacity to sue, as already mentioned, Professor Stone solves the\nquestion through the legal guardianship, which would be useful to represent Nature under\nsimilar terms it currently occurs with children, incompetent people, fictitious persons, and\neven real state.\nFinally, the third and fourth requirements to be a bearer of rights are somehow\ninterconnected because both refer to the legal remedies derived from an injury. In\ncontradistinction to what American tribunals have often argued, the redress for injuries\nshould orient to Nature, instead of human beings. To illustrate his point, Professor Stone\nuses the example of a car accident. He suggests that Nature entitles to repair its\n“environmental health ” under the same conditions as a person who has suffered a car\naccident concerning its medical expenses. He states that: “ Comparable expenses to a\npolluted river would be the costs of dredging, restocking with fish, arid so forth ”.700\nOne last thought-provoking reference consists of Stone’s view concerning the rights of\nNature from an international point of view. To him, the interactions among nations and the\nenvironment comprise an issue of distributive justice. For example, Stone is concerned about\nthe effects of climate change on developing countries, derived from the commercial activities\ncoming from developed nations. Likewise, he worries about the stock and overexploitation",

His dissenting opinion became a historic milestone among the\npromoters of Nature’s rights because he compared the environmental issues with the role\nplayed by “ inanimate objects ”, such as ships or corporations, whose legal personality was\nwide enough not only to be considered as legitimate adversaries before courts, but also to\naccomplish maritime or other business ends. In a certain way, legal standing would allow\n“environmental objects ” to sue for their preservation and look after their interests, through\nlegal representation. In the name of his defence of rights of Nature he even suggested the\nshift of the case label to “ Mineral King v.

For instance, he quoted the case of the\nriver, as “[...] the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes - fish, aquatic insects,\nwater ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are\ndependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life ”.704\nDouglas’ concern for Nature, however, was not new during the period of Sierra Club v.\nMorton. In fact, one of his earlier references about environment dates from 1950, through a\nkind of field diary about his “ discoveries ” in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest in the\nU.S.A. According to O’Fallon, that work was the first foray into autobiography, in which\nDouglas described his love for the wilderness.705\nMoreover, in 1965, he published a proposal to preserve the wilderness through a bill of\nrights, understood from the perspective of people’s rights instead of Nature’s ones in itself.706\nNotwithstanding, it calls attention to his previous knowledge about Leopold, dedicating even\none chapter of his work to a conservation land ethic. “ If we are to acquire a new land ethic,\n[Douglas asserts] we must make education a tool for understanding our link with nature ”.707\nOther authors have tackled the question of legal standing from diverse outlooks. One of\nthose voices corresponded to Professor Godofredo Stutzin , who suggested to stop thinking\nabout the environment as a human right, such as the Stockholm Declaration conceived it. He\nrather asked if one had not “[...] discovered the rights of a new legal entity called Nature\n(or the Environment) by admitting that the natural environment has to be protected against\nhuman activity ”.708\nShortly after, during the 1977 First National Congress of Environmental Law at the\nCatholic University of Valparaiso (Chile), Stutzin stated the recognition of Nature as a\njuristic person was not only lawfully possible but imperative. It depicted “[...] a genuine\n«sine qua non» condition to structure authentic Ecological Law, able to cease the\naccelerated process of Biosphere’s destruction ”.

To Stutzin, Nature constitutes a real [natural] being, an\nunmatched setting of organisation, stability, vitality, autonomy, and a performance of vital\nfunctions that enables human existence.709\nBarely from the late 2000s on, mainly because of the enactment of the Ecuadorian\nConstitution and the Bolivian Rights of Mother Earth Act, a series of South American writers\nretook the topic of rights of Nature. In parenthesis, during this period of thirty years\napproximately, the theory of Earth Jurisprudence emerged but it is part of the next\nsubheading. Thus, one of the most connotated authors has been Eugenio Zaffaroni , current\njudge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. His main contribution has been the\nassociation between the concepts of Nature’s rights and Pachamama, the indigenous\nexpression of how Latin American natives often refer to the environment. To Zaffaroni,\nPachamama has come as a resurgence of the ancestral culture of harmonious coexistence\nwithin Nature, incorporating itself to universal Constitutional Law. The promulgation of\nthese new legal frameworks has unquestionably implied, according to the author, a\nbreakpoint of the traditional constitutional paradigm, in which individuals have been the\nonly archetype of subjects of law. Anyway, the rights of Pachamama constitute a kind of\ncollective prerogative that contains others (human beings’ entitlements included). The\nrecognition of rights of Nature has allowed the emergence of a millenarian worldview, based\non harmony and balance of life. Indigenous call it sumak kawsay (good living), and it is\ncurrently part of the Ecuadorian Constitution.710\nOne should clarify that professor Zaffaroni has not been the only one who has addressed\nthe theme of rights of Nature in Latin America. Nevertheless, it would not be accurate to\nreview the immense range of authors, given that virtually all of them wrote their analysis\nafter the issuing of normative thereon. Therefore, it would be enough to mention the most\nremarkable cases. In Ecuador, for example, Ramiro Ávila was one of the most enthusiastic\npromoters or the recognition of rights of Nature at a constitutional level, through various\npublications.

Likewise, one cannot avoid mentioning the compilation\nof scholarly articles by Carlos Espinosa and Camilo Pérez or the book by Julio Prieto.711\nAlberto Acosta depicts an exceptional case because he led the inclusion of the rights of\nNature into the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution. His contribution did not come from the ambit\nof law but rather from activism and politics. Even though he is not a lawyer but an economist,\nhe supported and favoured the recognition of Nature as a subject of law in the constitution.\nHis position as president of the National Constituent Assembly was crucial to achieving the\ngoal.

His contribution also encompasses a broad\nhistorical review from the animal judgements to the most recent applications of rights of\nNature in the Latin American legal frameworks.

The\nfirst one consists of a joint effort by universities in Colombia and Ecuador, elaborated by\nLiliana Estupiñán et al., focusing on democratic constitutionalism. The second one is a\nMexican contribution, by José Garza and Roberto Rodríguez that embraces several articles\nconcerning a variety of legal and social topics. They comprise several issues about criminal\nand public law, and questions related to indigenous studies and sustainable development as\nwell.714\nDespite that Tāmati Kruger is not really an attorney but an anthropologist and political\nscientist, specialised in Māori studies, his contribution should be part of any legal\ncompilation concerning the rights of Nature. As David Boyd remembers, Kruger was the\nlead negotiator for the Ngāi Tūhoe, a Māori iwi (tribe) from New Zealand, concerning the\nTreaty of Waitangi settlement.

It experienced a transmutation from object to subject of law, acquiring rights\nand duties, but it is no longer object of those rights and duties. In this way, Kruger obtained\nthe enactment of the Te Urewera Act, by which the forested area was recognised as a legal\nperson in 2014, and an anticipation of what later occurred with the Whanganui River.719\nSeveral years later, in 2017, David Boyd -who is currently the U.N. Special Rapporteur\non human rights and the environment- published a legal review of the state-of-the-art\nadvances in matters of rights of Nature. Although it was not his first academic output, it is\nquite probably his most important work in this subject matter. His main objective, as Boyd\nhimself declares, consisted of determining to what extent laws recognise those rights. As a\nresult, he cannot conceal his concern about the inefficacy of legislation in helping to face the\necological crisis. “[E] nvironmental laws have put the brakes on some types of harm, [he",

Thus, in 1999, Berry wrote\nthat the leading cause of the planet’s destruction grounded on a “ mode of consciousness ”\nthat had bestowed all rights only on humans to the detriment of nonhumans, especially from\nthe standpoint of the industrial-commercial world. This vision emphasises that the very\nexistence of Nature aims at human possession and use.

On the one hand, the fact that nonhuman living\nbeings are mere goods or things and not subjects of law brings about a profound judicial and\nadministrative significance in terms of environmental protection. Nature does not possess\nany right to claim, depending exclusively on the human actions to obtain protection. On the\nother hand, Nature is currently property of individuals and legal persons, and laws, as\nmentioned earlier, tend to protect property rights instead of the environment. For this reason,\nas Susana Borràs has pointed out, “ The consequence has been that environmental laws and\nregulations, despite their preventive approach, have developed so as to legalize and\nlegitimate environmental harm .”723\nThe focal point of Berry’s approach, nevertheless, consists of encouraging a\nproportional distribution of the planet’s great commons (i.e., land, water, air and life\nsystems) among all the members of the Earth community, depending on their particular\nneeds. Human beings are not the centre but only one more element within the processes of\nlife. For that purpose, it is desirable to count on a “ new jurisprudence ”, Berry states, as an\nalternative mechanism to enhance the human-earth relationship, through the articulation of\nadequate conditions for the integral functioning of those life processes.724\nAs one can imagine, this proposal would bring about the overthrow of property rights.\n“The naive assumption that the natural world is there to be possessed and used by humans\nfor their advantage and in an unlimited manner [Berry states] cannot be accepted. The Earth\nbelongs to itself and to all the component members of the Earth community ”. That is why\nthe author recommends that all the members of the community share what he labels as the\n“Great Commons ”.725\nThis legal effect concerning a sudden disappearance of property rights, derived from the\ntransmutation of Nature from object to subject of law, seems to be pretty evident in practice.\nIf one rethinks about the case of slavery, the direct and immediate upshot coming from the\nmanumission consisted of the abolition of any kind of ownership over those human beings",

Consequently, it would not have to\nbe different in the case of the granting of legal personhood to Nature. It draws attention,\nhowever, that none of the authors before Berry have encompassed and explained in more\ndetail the question regarding the potential vanishing of property rights. From a conventional\ncivil law perspective, there are owners and belongings, as it were. If something is not a\nbelonging, s/he is probably the owner.\nIn other words, to guarantee the accurate condition of Earth’s existence, the discard of\nproperty rights or, at least their flexibility, should be necessary, given that they would not\nhave more value than any other prerogative. In case of conflict, it would be quite probable\nthat existence rights prevail over the property. Berry is pretty precise in affirming that human\nrights do not eliminate other modes of being to exist in their natural state. To him, “[h] uman\nproperty rights are not absolute. Property rights are simply a special relationship between\na particular human ‘owner’ and a particular piece of ‘property,’ so that both might fulfil\ntheir roles in the great community of existence ”.726\nIn any case, Berry’s call for a “ new jurisprudence ” became crucial to lay the\ngroundwork of “ Earth Jurisprudence ”, conceived by Judith Koons as an",

Moreover, a new scheme of governance will help to prevent or reduce\nthe loss of biodiversity, pollution, deforestation, climate change, and combat other\ncontemporary environmental problems. In Cullinan’s words, “ Earth Jurisprudence is\nneeded to guide the realignment of human governance systems with the fundamental\nprinciples of how the universe functions [i.e., Great Jurisprudence]”.731\nAccording to Warren, Filgueira, and Mason, an accurate interpretation of Cullinan’s\nopinion about why the traditional legal systems do not work out efficiently to protect the\nplanet has to do with the regulation of Earth as a thing. “ The reality [the authors argue] is\nthat legal systems treat the Earth as a ‘resource’ and value it only as such when in fact it is\nthe organism that sustains all forms of life ”.732\nIn response, as other authors previously analysed, Cullinan believes in a change in the\nconcept of Nature, from an object to a subject of law, i.e., as a holder of rights. Nevertheless,\nhe seems to differ in terms of scope because the last of his proposed principles of Earth\nJurisprudence individualises all members of the Earth community, without mentioning any\nexigency concerning ecosystems. Furthermore, he promotes the members of the Earth\ncommunity are entitled to receive protection and effective remedy against any human action\nthat violates their fundamental rights.733\nAlthough his stance keeps the general line of the legal holism, one should argue this\nopinion would step out from it, turning out even a little bit inadequate for the structure of\necocentrism. If one recalls the parallelism between Berry and Taylor, one should take into\naccount it referred to individualisation of rights (e.g., human rights for humans, river rights\nfor rivers, insect rights for insects, and so on) but within the community as a whole.\nCullinan’s suggestion seems to be different in that sense, given it regards to legal recognition\nof individuals, setting aside the comprehensive approach of community. Nevertheless, one\nwould have to consider that, in 2008, the author wrote in support of the recognition of natural\ncommunities and ecosystems as legal persons in the Tamaqua Borough, Pennsylvania. This\nreference leads to thinking about the fact that he is not opposed to the granting of legal\npersonhood to ecosystems and other similar natural entities.734",

Those roles get oriented to the evolution of the planet,\nand their limit is the right of the others. In this way, the integrity, balance, and health of the\ncommunity can get maintained.735\nFor Cullinan, the idea of a “Wild Law” is not contradictory as one could think given the\nopposite connotation between both terms in common parlance. In effect, the word “ Law” is\nan explicit reference to “ bind”, “constrain ”, “regularise ”, or “civilise”, the author argues.\nInstead, the expression “ wild” is usually close in meaning to “ unkempt”, “barbarous ”,\n“unrefined ”, “uncivilised ”, “unrestrained ”, “wayward”, “disorderly ”, “irregular”, “out of\ncontrol”, “unconventional ”, “undisciplined ”, “passionate ”, “violent”, “uncultivated ”, or\n“riotous”.736\nCullinan recognises the complexity to pigeonhole the concept of Wild Law within the\nconventional structures of the legal framework. He does not even see it as a branch of law.\nHe associates this notion with human governance instead. Summing up, Cullinan believes\nin Wild Law as a set of “[...] laws that regulate humans in a manner that creates the freedom\nfor all the members of the Earth Community to play a role in the continuing co-evolution of\nthe planet ”.737\nAnother remarkable aspect to mention consists of property rights. Cullinan seems to be\nvery conscious about the implications of a potential shift of world law and governance of\nownership, especially concerning the land. “ The challenge that now faces us is how to begin\nthe process of undoing the property systems that impede a proper relationship with land,\n[the author affirms] and to build a workable alternative in its place ”.738\nCullinan assumes beforehand an evident impact over the interplay between humanity\nand Nature, in terms of property rights. Furthermore, he accepts the position of Berry arguing\nthe current legislation and governance are obstructive instead of helpful to the flourishment\nof the planet. He also recognises that several voices have shown concern in front of a\npotential abolition of existing law and political system. In that regard, his stance regarding\nownership sounds more flexible than Berry’s one, stating explicitly that: “ I am not proposing\nthat property laws be abolished overnight. I am under no illusions about the short-term\nchaos that would ensue if this happened ”. Thus, he admits any implementation of Earth",

From\nthe outset, the Fund aimed at helping “[...] people in various communities research and\nprepare permit appeals ”. So, around 1997, most of its clients were community groups.740\nConscious of conventional Western laws treat Nature as a collection of commodities\nand as the property of someone, Linzey and the CELDF started to advise some local\ncommunities in the U.S.A. about the mechanisms to pass ordinances recognising the rights\nof Nature. In his words, “ Today, it is our communities and natural systems that are treated\nas property under the law-just as slaves once were-because what’s in our communities is\nroutinely bought, sold, and traded without a whisker of local control ”. The first community\nthat enacted an ordinance against the sewage sludge, but recognising Nature’s rights, was\nTamaqua Borough, in 2006. It is a small town located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.741\nNevertheless, Linzey did not do it alone. Mari Margil , the closest colleague of Linzey\nat the CELDF, and current Executive Director of the Center for Democratic and\nEnvironmental Rights (CDER) also did his part. Thus, she participated as a consultant for\nthe 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution, joint with Linzey, which was the first one all over the\nworld, in acknowledging the rights of Nature. Likewise, she worked in India for the\nrecognition of the legal personality of the Ganga river basin in 2017.742\nHer view about the CELDF’s defence of local communities was not entirely optimistic.\nShe thought about corporations re-wrote the laws or exhausted communities presenting\npermit applications several times until they obtained the corresponding authorisations to\nconstruct or undertake their projects. She affirmed: “ We helped hundreds of communities\nappeal these corporate permits - but even when we won, we lost ”. For this reason, she has\nconcluded that traditional laws do not protect the environment, and somehow legalise\nenvironmental harm. “ At best, they merely slow the rate of its destruction ”, she argues. As a\nresponse, Margil advocates the recognition of rights of ecosystems and natural communities",

    "text": "Just like it occurred in the ethical approach, one can address the recognition of Nature as a\nlegal person from different points of view. Indeed, one could affirm that there is virtually a\nlegal proposal for each ethical way of addressing the moral considerability of Nature. From\nanthropocentrism to ecocentrism, one could find multiple ranges of lawful regulations\n(including soft law) that could fit almost precisely with the respective ethical scope.\nSince this perspective, an outstanding arrangement has been developed by Dinah\nShelton, who has gathered some different ways to address the legal personality of Nature in\nfour categories. They are the public trust, animals, ecosystems, and the whole. Consequently,\nbeing an extremely useful taxonomy of approaches, this subsection follows Shelton’s\norganisation.744 Thus, table # 7 shows an exemplificative illustration.\nFrom the outset, it would be useful to clarify a couple of aspects. On the one hand, the\nquestion of animal rights has been emphasised and unfolded in more detail within this\nsection lest the confusion of the proposed theoretical scope. In a colloquial sense, there is an\nequivocal idea that rights of Nature are synonym of the rights of animals. So, it is necessary\nto clarify concepts. On the other hand, both approaches derived from the holistic insight, i.e.,\nNature and ecosystems, will get analysed altogether due to the legal foundations for the new\nnormative grounds on similar scholar sources.",

Initially, this doctrine referred to commercial\npurposes, i.e., to the “[...] principle that navigable waters [were] preserved for the public\nuse, and that state [was] responsible for protecting the public’s right to the use ”, according\nto Garner.745\nAccording to Sax, the employment of this principle, an aspect that used to draw much\nattention in Roman and English law, brought into question the nature of private property in\nrivers, the sea, and the seashore, i.e., “ highways and running waters ”, mainly concerning\nnavigation and fishing.746 From this argument, and by means of a detailed analysis of\nabundant case law, Sax applied the doctrine theoretically to the aim of protecting natural\nresources, coming to design what a large panel of authors747 has termed “ the new public\ntrust” or, at least the very beginning.\nLikewise, the public trust doctrine has even influenced the judgements seriously. For\nexample, Alexandra Klass recalls that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin decided, in 1972,\nthat the prohibition against the filling of wetlands abutting or lying close to navigable waters\nwas constitutional. Therefore, the taking was not subject to compensation. In plain language,\nas one can read in the Wex Legal Dictionary of Cornell University, when the government\ntakes private property for public use, it must pay “ just compensations ” to proprietors.\nNevertheless, the Court did not order the redress. It rather interestingly characterised the case\nunder the following terms: “[...] it is a conflict between the public interest in stopping the\ndespoliation of natural resources, which our citizens until recently have taken as inevitable\nand for granted, and an owner's asserted right to use his property as he wishes ”.748\nConsequently, the overall idea seems to be quite simple, just like it was written in the\n1971 amendment of the Pennsylvanian state constitution and others later. That provision, in\nforce until these days and largely quoted in the environmental literature, reads:\n“Pennsylvania’s public natural resources are the common property of all the people,\nincluding generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall\nconserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people ”, meaning, in the end, that State\nis a kind of steward of natural resources for the public benefit.749\nTaking Pennsylvania’s provision as the starting point, the first conclusion one can draw\nwith regard to the initial posed hypotheses, then, consists of natural resources are still the",

Under these circumstances,\nalthough one can speak about restrictions of property rights in the name of public benefit,\none cannot deny the existence of sovereign entitlements on natural resources. In plain\nlanguage, States are able to maintain control over Nature through the implementation of the\npublic trust doctrine, reproducing the anthropocentric handle of the ecosystems over time.\nSecondly, as Klass holds, the public trust doctrine emphasises the acknowledgement of\nenvironmental and substantive rights. As mentioned, however, both approaches correspond\nto a human prerogative, instead of any entitlement in favour of Nature. Consequently, under\nthese premises, Nature is not the bearer of rights, while humans continue to be legitimate\nholders. In this regard, Pennsylvania constitution is explicit, for example, when it establishes\nthat: “The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural,\nscenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment ”. In the same sense, Klass mentions\nthe case of 1972 Montana’s constitution, which defines the clean and healthful environment\nas an inalienable right. In consequence, although one should deem this doctrine could be\nuseful to handle environmental issues, it does not fit the propositions of rights of Nature in\npractice. It tends to perpetuate the anthropocentric sight of a right to an adequate\nenvironment for human sake.750\nSumming up, it turns out irrefutable the successful expansion of the public trust doctrine\nas a mechanism of environmental protection in virtually all the United States, as Klass\nargues. Indeed, several state constitutions have already included those provisions. In\naddition, Blumm and Guthrie have been theorising around the internationalisation of the\ndoctrine. Some of their examples of countries in which there are regulations thereon are\nIndia, Pakistan, Philippines, Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Ecuador, and\nCanada.751 Nevertheless, one cannot lose sight of the fact that they are still domestic\nexperiences, not necessarily applicable to international law. Moreover, it continues to\nperpetuate the anthropocentric idea of humans managing an ensemble of goods to their\nbenefit, an argument that the postulates concerning the recognition of rights of Nature deny\nfrom the outset.",

It is even worth mentioning an essay by the Harvard Law Review\nAssociation concerning modern examples of animals as plaintiffs before tribunals.752\nThe “personification ” of animals in law is not a novelty. Indeed, Osenbrüggen dedicated\nan entire chapter of his book, “ Studies on German and Swiss legal history ” to explain how\nthe idea of the “ personification of animals ” has supported the prosecution and other\ninterventions of animals before courts during ancient and medieval times. His reasoning,\nfollowing the interpretation of Evans, consisted of equating rights and duties of animals,\nnamely “[...] only by an act of personification [...] the brute can be placed in the same\ncategory as man and become subject to the same penalties ”.753\nFurthermore, Osenbrüggen accounts that several animal behaviours were criminalised,\neven with capital punishment, especially when they brought about human’s death.\nConcomitantly, as members of the household, animals and servants had the same rights,\nwhich sometimes were also parallel to women’s, such as the right to the wergild (also\nwergeld, or weregild). In the ancient Germanic law, the wergild comprised of “[...] the\namount of compensation paid by a person committing an offense to the injured party or, in\ncase of death, to his family ”. The original quotation corresponds to Grimm: “[...] in the\nancient times, servants were treated like pets, and pets like servants, thus being conferred\nwith certain rights of people, especially in the manner of repentance and wergild ”.754\nNevertheless, to avoid any misunderstanding, one should bear in mind that although\nwomen, servants, and animals were-under certain circumstances-equally treated, they were\nnot at the same status of man. There is no opposite evidence in Evans’ treatise or any other\nscholar work thereon. According to those archaic regulations, although the laws vested kind\nof “human rights and responsibilities ” to those “ beasts” under the protection of man, that\nman was the master, i.e., the head of the family and the landlord.755",

One can find the concept of wergild in Encyclopædia Britannica (2011) para. 1st.\nGrimm’s text originally in German reads: “ es lag ganz in der anficht des alterthums, nicht nur knechte wie\nhausthiere, fondern auch hausthiere wie knechte zu behandeln, dem thier alfo gewiffe me nfchliche rechte,\nnamentlich in art und weife der buße und des wergeldes einzuräumen ”.

In effect, Osenbrüggen accounts that “[...] personality was also conferred to\nanimals when, in the absence of real human witnesses, they used to appear as evidence\nbefore courts ”.756 In Evan’s opinion, this practice was not sufficient in itself to explain the\norigin and purpose of those legal procedures accurately. In ancient times, the personification\nof animals got oriented to justify their punishment but not their rights.757",

He addressed the status of animals from both points of\nview, namely as objects susceptible of appropriation and-at the same time-as beings\n“endowed with sensibility, capable of feeling pleasure and pain, with affections and hatreds,\nand appetites to satisfy ”. It interestingly implies suggestive anticipation to sentientism. More\nexplicitly, Dinzelbacher accepts that dogs, cats, and some roosters “[...] could be invested\nwith a juridical personality ”.761",

Duméril (1880) 5;\nDinzelbacher (2002) 421.\nIn any case, animals continue to be goods, even commodities, before the law. As already\nseen, the express recognition of property upon them, existing in the CITES Convention,\nconstitute an example, particularly relating to exemptions to trade. In fact, one can find a\nprovision to “ specimens that are personal or household effects ”, and the consequent\nallusions to their owners. Curiously, the CITES is entirely quoted within the decision about\nthe legal personality of the glaciers Gangotri and Yamunotri, by the Indian High Court of\nUttarakhand at Nainital.762\nLikewise, one can find other references to animals as goods, (including means of\nproduction) and the existence of “ owners”, in several regional European instruments. In this\nregard, it proves obvious to infer that those legal instruments, aimed at regulating the\nproduction of food or any other outcomes for human benefit, entail the notion of animals\nlike goods or commodities implicitly. That is the case, for instance, of the European\nConvention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter, focused on minimising the adverse\neffects on “ the quality of the meat ”.763\nSimilarly, in the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming\nPurposes, for example, animals are those “[...] bred or kept for the production of food, wool,\nskin or fur or for other farming purposes [...]”. This provision coincides with the explicit\nadmission that certain animals are used “[...] for food, clothing and as beasts of burden\n[...]”, recited in the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for\nExperimental and Other Scientific Purposes.764\nOn their part, the European Convention for the Protection of Animals during\nInternational Transport, its reviewed version, and the European Convention for the\nProtection of Pet Animals set forth explicitly the ownership of domestic animals (i.e., mainly\nthose aimed at private enjoyment and companionship) and the possibility of their trade.765\nThe Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals comprises\nan exceptional case. It is probably one of the very few instruments [maybe even the only\none], in which animals constitute “ population ” or “members” of a species. Thus, this\nprovision establishes: “ Migratory species means the entire population or any\ngeographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild",

Indeed, a significant number of\nlawmakers around the world have fostered the incorporation of provisions [even criminal\nones] against unlawful commercial activities and others, such as abuse, cruelty, harmful\nresearch, participation in any kinds of shows, among others. At the statutory level, those\nrules have reached relative success and met those goals in most cases. One can find a concise\nand accurate review in Greg Miller.770\nMoreover, from the late twentieth century, some activists and academic sectors have\nbeen promoting a change in the judicial status of animals, particularly concerning great apes.\nThe most common employed mechanism has been the conferment of specific rights, which\nhas relatively brought about successful results in terms of fauna’s protection, chiefly\ndiminishing the mistreatment. Nevertheless, the enshrinement of entitlements does not\nnecessarily mean the acknowledgement of legal personality, i.e., that animals continue to be\nobjects instead of subjects of law. Consequently, one should be aware of the impossibility\nof evaluating the efficacy of the bestowal of legal personhood entirely. In some measure, it\nis often difficult to notice if normative advancements in this field are realistic or just\nrhetorical.\nThe paradigmatic case has been the Spanish one, whose 2008 parliament passed a\nresolution banning experimentation and research that hurt simians, just like their possession\nwith commercial ends, or aimed at their exhibition in shows. Spanish legislators even came\nto establish that illegal trade, unlawful possession, and abuse of animals are aggravated\nfelonies. In addition, the resolution encompassed the undertaking of actions aimed at\nprotecting nonhuman hominids against abuse, slavery, torture, death, and extinction, by\nmeans of the adherence to the “ Great Ape Project ”. This project comprises an international\nmovement, inspired by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, which was created in 1994 to\npromote the fundamental rights to life, freedom, and non-torture of great nonhuman\nprimates, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos.771",

As a brief digression, for\nexample, it is curious how the protection of apes and support of bullfights could concur in\nthe same legislative framework. Likewise, it is worth getting questioned how in a country\nwhere there are no wild hominids, the parliament can prioritise the issue of a normative to\nprotect them, among other questioning approaches.777\nWith hindsight, if one scrutinises the resolution text, it turns out hard to conclude to\nwhat extent its provisions depicted a real milestone for the acceptance of animals as holders\nof rights, and consequently as legal persons, at that moment. Indeed, the word “ right” did\nnot even appear within the document, an aspect that could constitute a mere formality but\nillustrates quite well the activist rhetoric. In plain language, the real inconsistency concerned\nto the fact that the instrument was not really mandatory in practice. It was not a full-blown\nlaw, but solely a parliamentary compromise to adapt Spanish legislation to the principles of\nthe Great Ape Project within a year,778 but it never happened.779\nThere is another example in New Zealand, where one can infer a similar academic\nsensation of stark contrast about these legislative achievements, despite the fact that the legal\nreform was actually a given on this occasion. In effect, albeit gorillas, chimpanzees,\nbonobos, and orangutans could be still the property of someone in New Zealand, the use of\nthese “non-human hominids ” in research, testing or teaching is currently restricted.780\nNevertheless, as mentioned, the opinions of experts were not concurrent in this case too.\nWhile some authors saw the norm like a valid improvement of the living conditions of great",

Those recognitions\nare not always consistent with the actual contents of the law, or any other normative\ninstrument. For example, Emily Fitzgerald argues that Swiss, German and Indian\nConstitutions had granted rights to nonhuman animals (dolphins in the case of India) and\nhad declared their legal personality, an affirmation widely reproduced by news media.783\nNevertheless, once one examines those regulations, one should conclude that this assertion\nis not correct.\nFirstly, the Swiss constitution appears in several documents as one of the landmarks in\nthe field of animal law and its progress. Moreover, it is one of the older legal instruments\nexisting in this subject matter, considering it came into effect in 1992. Evans explains that\nthis successful 1992 reform allowed the regulation of transgenic research, but later\nlawmakers rejected a total prohibition of animal research in 1999. Nowadays, albeit the\nSwiss constitution is quite probably one of the most comprehensive instruments aimed at\ntheir protection, animals are still goods to use, or even commodities one can import, trade,\nand transport. They are not definitively the subjects of law within the Swiss legislation, but\nrather things, even though it contradicts the Civil Code’s provisions directly.784\nSecondly, the 2002 amendment of the German constitution (so-called Basic Law for the\nFederal Republic of Germany) meant the incorporation of the phrase “ and animals ” (official\ntranslation) or “ and the animals ” (according to some researchers such as Nattrass, Eisen, and\nEvans) into the Article 20a. In general terms, it implied “[...] the state [would] protect the\nnatural foundations of life and animals by legislation and, in accordance with law and\njustice [...]”. Its transcendence is also indisputable in the framework of animal defence,\nabove all considering the period of issuing. Nonetheless, it does not virtually mean\nrecognition of rights, let alone of legal personality. If one thoroughly reflects about the theme\nin the constitutional context, one can notice an overall tendency to deem animals as things,",

The reason would be that\nthere is somehow a kind of trend towards the standardisation of the most problematic animal\nissues (i.e., abuse, cruelty, trafficking, and so on). These harmful human conducts have\nbrought about an increase in regulations that is restricting them all over the world.\nNevertheless, one should have it in mind that speaking about rights while animals are still\nthings before the law does not constitute a coherent discourse in legal terms.\nIn this sense, a cutting-edge and useful tool to measure and compare the welfare of\nanimals among countries is the “ Animal Protection Index (API) ”. The API is an instrument\nthat unfolds online geo-referenced data about various parameters of policy and legislation,\nconstructed from information by fifty different nations in the whole continents. For example,\nif one reviews the indicator concerning “ laws that prohibit causing animal suffering either\nby a deliberate act of cruelty or by a failure to act ” (notice the express allusion to\nsentientism), one can find several examples similar to those mentioned in this section.\nHowever, one cannot argue if they deal with or not the assignment of specific rights to\nanimals, let alone legal personality.794\nTo recapitulate, in the same line as the previously addressed ethical approach, the core\ntarget of this dissertation does not have to do with the prospective international personhood\nof animals. In either event, a proposal in this sense would lead unfailingly to the\nindividualisation of beings, contaminating somehow the scope of legality and jurisprudence.\nIt already occurred in medieval Europe. Thus, it would not be adequate to experience the\nprosecution of some rats for “[...] having feloniously eaten up and wantonly destroyed the\nbarley-crop of [...] the French fields of Autun.

While the former (in\neffect since 1976) constitutes the starting point of the anthropocentric perspective in\ninternational law, the later (in force since 1975) consists in one of the first and few\ninternational legal instruments whose contents are strongly biased in favour of ecocentric\nand biocentric postures. Indeed, one can even perceive a straightforward tendency to\nemphasise the importance of a specific kind of ecosystem, wetlands (ecocentrism), including\nits core inhabitants, waterfowl (biocentrism) over people’s benefits and property rights.\nTo an extent, even though some writers like Borràs are a little bit sceptical about the\ncompletely non-anthropocentric character of the instrument, they end up agreeing the\nconvention acknowledges, at least in part, the inherent worth of Nature, emphasising\nenvironmental injury rather than impacts on humans. “ The ultimate goal of these treaties is\ncertainly to serve human purposes [...]”, she argues, albeit there is not strictly any reference\nof people’s benefits or the like in the whole text.799\nFrom the outset, one can notice the very title excludes any remark on people or their\nwelfare. Afterwards, the document interestingly incorporates one of the central tenets of Paul\nTaylor’s biocentrism, the so-called “ interdependence of man and his environment ”, which\ndenotes an idea of equality between people and Nature, instead of the anthropocentric notion\nof human supremacy. Moreover, the only remark of dependence alluded within the\nconvention consists of the ecological interplay between wetlands and aquatic birds. There is\na kind of constant emphasis on the importance of wetlands and waterfowl, while there is not\nany reference to human significance in contrast. Thus, the only mention of “ human\ninterference ” has a negative connotation in context, given its subtle association with\nundesirable technological developments and pollution. To put on metaphoric words, the\nobligation to count on any information concerning the shifts of the ecological character of\necosystems, derived from the technology, somehow resembles the action to clean the bubblevisor of technology-oriented culture that distorts the human vision, described by Cullinan.800\nAnother substantial difference regarding the International Bill of Human Rights consists\nof the way how the Ramsar Convention addresses the question of sovereignty . Unlike the\ncovenants, sovereignty constitutes a restricted conception in this case, in which there is no\nmanner to “ freely dispose of natural wealth and resources ”, invoking self-determination.",

Consequently, as one can infer,\n“conservation ” and “wise use” are concepts utterly opposed to the “ freely dispose of ”. Thus,\nthe estates included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance are precisely subject\nto specific constraints of conservation.801\nOn the contrary, one could affirm that the Ramsar Convention does account on\nsovereignty as a limit to the conservation and wise use of wetlands. It principally occurs\nwhen it lays down that: “ The inclusion of a wetland in the List does not prejudice the\nexclusive sovereign rights of the Contracting Party in whose territory the wetland is\nsituated”.802 It means that States could include areas of their territories in the list or exclude\nthem, invoking a fully-fledged exercise of sovereignty in both cases.\nNevertheless, albeit the country’s willingness to incorporate an area to the list, or even\ndismiss it, based on “ urgent national interests ”, effectively constitutes a sovereign decision\nin its own right, the State should ratify the existence of a severe restriction of activities during\nthe period of inclusion. The allowed activities chiefly circumscribe to conservation, wise\nuse, research, and exchange of data regarding wetlands. Moreover, if a state party resolves\nto delete or restraint the boundaries of those lands, it “[...] should as far as possible\ncompensate for any loss of wetland resources, and in particular it should create additional\nnature reserves for waterfowl and for the protection [...] of the original habitat ”.\nAdditionally, member states must immediately inform any change of the wetlands’ condition\nto the IUCN, which is the institution in charge.803\nFinally, any connotation concerning property rights or economic interests shows up\ngenerally weak all through the Ramsar Convention. It includes some also feeble allusions to\nwetlands and waterfowl as natural resources of an international character, which could\nequate to deem them as material goods. Indeed, save a cursory reference to the countless\neconomic value of the wetlands-joint with cultural, scientific, and recreational ones-within\nthe recitals, there is not truly a vigorous scheme in matters of ownership.

By and large, the Earth constitutes a living being and the home for humans, although\nthe text does not obviate the existence of animals, plants, soil, water, and air, namely the\nelements of the Land Ethic. Another interesting allusion corresponds to the notion of\n“respect for Nature ”, a wink for the biocentrism of Paul Taylor.813\nIn this regard, the principle of respect and care for the community of life embraces the\necocentric recognition of interdependence among all beings,814 no matter the worth those\nindividuals represent for people. The use of the expression “ worth” overrules any potential\nhierarchy between humans and non-humans. Moreover, given its strong connotation biased\ntowards an economic context, it also removes any level of importance among animals,\nplants, or one another. One should recall that the Western world tends to grant more value\nto those species useful for food, attire, and other similar products and services. Therefore,\nthis tenet contradicts the mainstream.815",

Notwithstanding, as mentioned, while Taylor detaches\nhumans from other living beings, Berry associates all members of the Earth community. In other words, Taylor\nbelieves in the interdependence between people and nonhumans and the other way around. Berry sees an\ninterdependent behaviour among all instead.\n815 The Earth Charter (2000) Principle I (1).\nOn the other hand, two out of three elements of Land Ethic explicitly appear within the\ntext, i.e., integrity and beauty. Effectively, there is a specific section addressing the\necological integrity, which highlights the protection and restoration of ecosystems, with\nparticular concern on biodiversity and processes of life. The charter prioritises the holistic\nprofile of Nature, instead of natural resources seen separately, promoting a comprehensive\nhandle of environmental issues in this way. Likewise, the beauty of Earth constitutes an\nelement to secure for the present and future generations, an aspect that one could visualise\nthrough the flourishing of human and ecological communities.816\nFurthermore, although the third characteristic of Land Ethic, i.e., stability, does not\nappear in the charter’s text explicitly, one can notice several references. Thus, if one assumes\nthe notion of stability in terms of diversity, as Callicott proposed, it is going to be relatively\neasy to find various allusions to the protection of diversity of life. They mostly concern the\nsafeguard of the Earth’s regenerative capacity and the protection of life support systems.\nLastly, the charter also promotes the security of Earth’s bounty for future generations. All of\nthem imply somehow the maintenance of the stock over time.817\nAdditionally, the charter includes an explicit recognition of the impacts derived from\nthe economic activities over the environment. Thus, the patterns of production and\nconsumption constitute the direct sources of ecological devastation, depletion of resources,\nand loss of species. This correlation between environmental impacts and economic activities\nturns out concomitant of anthropocentric criteria, which ecocentrists frequently criticise.\nMoreover, the charter identifies too an association between development and poverty,\ncoinciding with the theoretical interplay addressed previously. To cope with this so-called\n“global situation ”, the instrument appeals to the notion of “ economic justice ”, primarily\naimed at the eradication of poverty, the promotion of a human, equitable, and environmental\ndevelopment, the affirmation of gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable\ndevelopment, and the defence of rights without discrimination.818\nAs one can notice, the suggested measures to combat the ecological crisis include not\nonly strong green connotations. By way of critical opinion, if one comprehensively reads the\ninstrument, it is hard to overlook several human-centred actions, derived from the endeavour\nto face the problems. They are, for example, the promotion of human development and the\nmanagement, use, and exploitation of natural resources as sources of water, clean air, food,",

In practice,\ntheir application does not mean necessarily a wrong decision. It is simply they set apart from\nthe ecocentric essence of the instrument. Indeed, one can find measures much more oriented\nto the rhetoric of the charter, such as the reduction, reuse and recycle of materials, or the\nchange of patters of production and consumption.819\nIn a similar vein, Robin Attfield brings into question the lack of clarity to determine the\nobligations from present to future regenerations. Beyond the inclusion of this subject matter\ndemands an anthropocentric understanding [in itself] of the whole picture, the author argues\nthat both of the groups are not comparable, mainly owing to the existence of forthcoming\npeople directly depends on current actions, which one cannot identify or define. 820\nAn additional and recurrent aspect throughout this research has to do with property\nrights. The charter expressly recognises the existence of ownership of natural resources,\nalthough limited by environmental restrictions. One can read: “ Accept that with the right to\nown, manage, and use natural resources comes the duty to prevent environmental harm and\nto protect the rights of people ”.821 Nevertheless, although the shift of the paradigm of\nproperty rights cannot occur overnight, as Cullinan has observed, their explicit\nacknowledgement contradicts the spirit of ecocentrism in one way or another.822",

According to Pablo Sólon, former Permanent\nRepresentative of Bolivia to the United Nations, the conference counted on more than 35,000\nattendants and more than 100 delegations coming from different countries. David Boyd\nargues that Cormac Cullinan led the group who drafted the document, which makes sense\nconsidering the contents of the text.824\nOn 7 May 2010, Pablo Sólon submitted the conclusions of the conference and the draft\ndeclaration to the U.N. General Assembly, emphasising primarily a set of seven tenets to\ncope with the climate change and a list of proposed rights of mother earth, which the draft\ninstrument includes. Nevertheless, given that the original language of the document was\nSpanish, the translation elaborated by the United Nations differs from what one can find in\nthe official website of the declaration, i.e., the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature\n(GARN). As a result, although most of the translated texts are quite similar, there are specific\npoints in which both diverge significantly. For example, one can read “ Mother Earth is a\nliving being” within the GARN’s document. While the U.N.’s translation declares “ Mother\nEarth is a living thing”, bringing about a confusing connotation, above all considering that\nthe advocates of the rights of Nature are trying to emphasise a transmutation of the legal\ncondition from object to subject of law. Therefore, the version employed in this dissertation\ncorresponds to GARN’s one.825\nIn either event, it is worth clarifying that both versions of the declaration define the\nexpression “ beings” in terms of “[...] ecosystems, natural communities, species and all other\nnatural entities that exist as part of Mother Earth ”. Consequently, this provision allows\ntaking it for granted the holistic approach of the whole document.826\nFrom then on, as one can notice in the website of the U.N.’s platform, a series of\ninteractive dialogues has occurred, the Secretary-General of the Harmony with Nature has\npublished several reports, and the U.N. General Assembly has adopted various resolutions.\nNevertheless, no real progress seems to have happened until now.827",

Its structure encompasses the concept of Nature, its inherent rights,\npeople’s obligations, and a couple of definitions. However, by way of a curious remark, it\nturns out weird that a legal instrument only provides duties for one single kind of participants\n(humans). At the same time, however, the document includes rights for all the rest of\nparticipants, i.e., Mother Earth, ecosystems, species, and human beings. Consequently, it\ndoes not deal with correlative entitlements and responsibilities.\nFrom the outset, within the preamble, it highlights the idea that Mother Earth constitutes\na living community, where human beings are only another part. Indeed, there is more than\none explicit elucidation concerning the fact that human rights are not the only existing\nentitlements and the necessity to recognise the rights of the Mother Earth and those of other\nliving beings that form part of her. It openly evokes Berry’s argument regarding the existence\nof different rights for different species (i.e., human rights, bird rights, river rights, insect\nrights, and so on).828\nAlthough the proposal’s declaration does not include verbatim all the principles that\nguide the ecocentrism, especially the stances of Land Ethic and Earth Jurisprudence, one can\nfind some elements explicitly and other references in context. Thus, for example, the [either\nEarth or biotic] community of beings is expressly present both in the preamble and the body\nof the document.829\nWith regard to Land Ethic’s tenets, save for the notion of “ beauty”, the other principles\ndo appear within the text of the draft. For instance, the expression “ integrity” forms part of\nseveral provisions, mainly as the expected result coming from the exercise of rights, namely\nany human action taken in the ambit of the rights of Mother Earth should maintain her\nintegrity, even though they deal with her own rights or restoration. On its part, the proposal\nmentions “ stability” in terms of balance. Despite that the idea of balance possesses a similar\nscope than integrity, i.e., as a kind of limitation for human actions, it also makes out how\nhuman rights and the rights of others are at the same level. By the way, this last statement\ncoincides with the maintenance of a dynamic balance between both kinds of rights, required\nby Earth Jurisprudence.830",

It is perhaps one of the clue reasons why one cannot identify any\nreal progress thereon.\nCormac Cullinan is of the opinion that the implementation of Earth governance at the\ninternational level is not possible immediately because there is an issue of scale. “ At the level\nof the ‘international community’, [he admits] which is populated with yet more artificial\nlegal persons (states and international organisations), the sense of intimacy and common\npurpose may have disappeared altogether ”.

Nevertheless, the change does not respond to a breakpoint but a slowmoving but continuous process. It does not occur overnight; it takes time.837\nIn any case, the most relevant contribution coming from this proposal relates to the\ncompilation of a set of rights, which are useful to promote its application more efficiently\nwithin smaller geographical areas. The rights of Earth and all beings are life, existence,\nrespect, regeneration of bio-capacity, the continuation of vital cycles and processes,\nmaintenance of identity and integrity, self-regulation, interrelation, water, clean air, integral\nhealth, freedom of contamination, pollution, and toxic or radioactive waste, no-modification\nof genetic structure, restoration, having a place, playing a role, well-being, freedom from\ntorture or cruel treatment.838 As mentioned, however, one should also highlight that the\nobligations curiously correspond only to human beings, States, and institutions.

On the one hand, the Constitution expressly\nprovides that natural resources are the inalienable property of the State, being even able to\nparticipate in profits earned. On the other hand, Ecuadorian State has sovereign power over\nbiodiversity. Moreover, it can exercise the right to administer, regulate, monitor, and\nmanage, besides biological diversity, energy in all its forms, nonrenewable natural resources,\ngenetic heritage, radio spectrum, water, among others.842 Consequently, one can affirm that\nthe Ecuadorian Constitution drifts between ecocentric and anthropocentric perspectives.\nWith the end of counting on thorough legislation in this matter, the National Assembly\nissued the General Organic Code of Proceedings in 2015. It aimed at regulating the\nprocessual activities concerning all the legal matters, except for the constitutional, electoral,\nand criminal one. Likewise, the Ecuadorian government enacted the Environmental Organic\nCode in 2017 to protect the rights of Nature. Both laws experienced amendments in 2018,\nproviding a new set of measures to represent more effectively Nature’s interests.843\nIn terms of judicial representation, the General Organic Code of Proceedings has been\ndecisive. It explicitly establishes that Nature can be a claimant, and any person, legal person,\ncollective organisation, or the ombudsperson can represent it. Curiously, nevertheless, the\ncode prohibits any lawsuit against Nature. In addition, the code of proceedings specifies that\nenvironmental and human (including belongings) damages are separate and independent,\nwhich allows implementing the constitutional right of restoration in practice. Therefore,\nthrough this provision, one can present two detached lawsuits, one in the name of people and\nanother in the name of Nature. Consequently, it is possible to speak about the right of\nNature’s restoration specifically. Promoters of Earth Jurisprudence surely see this provision\npositively, above all, considering that Cullinan already opinionated of this separation\nfavourably in 2011.844\nOn its part, the Environmental Organic Code also includes provisions concerning the\nrepresentation of Nature but outside the realm of the judiciary. Thus, it provides that National",

Additionally, one can\nfind an explanation in detail about the differentiation of the right of restoration, from the Ecuadorian\nperspective, in Bedón (2016) 137ff.\nDecentralised System of Environmental Management oversees the tutelage of Nature.\nLikewise, the National Environmental Authority exerts the “ juridical and administrative\ntutelage”.845\nMoreover, this environmental code includes provisions aimed at the protection of the\nrights of Nature as well. For instance, the law regulates those activities susceptible of\ngenerating environmental impacts on Nature, establishes the comprehensive redress in case\nof damages against Nature, and declares that the respect of rights of Nature constitutes public\ninterest, among others. One of the most thought-provoking aspects mentioned in the Code\nconsists of defining the principle so-called “ In dubio pro natura ”. It reads: “ When there is\nlack of information, legal void, the contradiction of provisions, or doubts concerning the\nscope of the legal regulations in environmental matters, it will be applied what favours\nNature and the environment. In the case of conflict of these laws, one should similarly do ”.846\nIt would be of importance to elaborate a study in detail regarding this tenet. However, it\nwould comprise new research.\nSumming up, although the Ecuadorian Constitution and legislation reproduce the idea\nof Nature as a whole, one should admit the specification of who can represent it both in the\nlegal arena and before courts constitutes a positive contribution. Effectively, the lack of\ndefinition of ecosystems, species, and biotic communities as the concrete bearers of rights\ncreates an abstraction much more challenging to protect in practice. The rights of an\nundefined entelechy will tend to fade easier. However, it is a valid contribution that any\nperson or institution, including the ombudsperson, be able to depict natural interests.\nEspecially in the judicial field, it makes more feasible the defence of Nature, by avoiding the\nexigence of conditions, such as ownership or possession of any benefit, that rather hurdles\nthe environmental protection.",

According to Rodgers, it deals with the longest-running dispute over\nindigenous Maori territories in the history of New Zealand. The claim was officially brought\nand registered in December 1990 by the Maori Trust Board, initially conducting litigation to\nobtain the restitution for natural resources, customary lands and governance of the river\nsystem; which means, in other words, goods deemed Maori property and their\nmanagement.847\nNevertheless, if one reviews the 1999 report by the Waitangi Tribunal, one will notice\nthe conflict dates from the nineteenth century, having its origin in alleged breaches of\nprinciples of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Therefore, it is the result of a long-standing and\ntedious popular struggle to defence not only property and its administration, but also ancient,\ntraditional, and cultural values, relative to memories of ancestors and history, sources of\nphysical and spiritual nourishment, sacred places, and so forth.848\nIn 2012, as a previous step towards the enactment of the law, the Whanganui Iwi\n[people] and the Crown signed the agreement so-called Tūtohu Whakatupua , whose meaning\nrepresents the commitment between the parties to progress the development of Te Awa\nTupua arrangements. In a certain way, it comprises a kind of reaffirmation of the historical\nTreaty of Waitangi.849\nBy and large, the document establishes the fundamental characteristics of the so-called\nTe Awa Tupua (textually “the whole of the river”) , which “[...] comprises the Whanganui\nRiver as an indivisible and living whole, from the mountains to the sea, incorporating its\ntributaries and all its physical and metaphysical elements ”. Furthermore, both parties\nreached a compromise on enacting legislation to give effect to the deed of settlement they\nconsented.850",

From then on, Te Awa Tupua was going to be the holder\nof the funds and property, although without derogating existing private property or hurdling\npublic access and use.851 By way of comment, Te Awa Tupua constitutes another archetype\nof the uniqueness comprised of the diversity, claimed from the perspectives of the Earth\nJurisprudence and even the Respect for Nature, and alluded to in the Declaration of the\nRights of Mother Earth. Interestingly, its origin in the traditional native worldview of the\nMaori people demonstrates that philosophy or law are not the only sources to support the\nrecognition of Nature as a bearer of rights, which concedes more consistency to the proposal.\nThe process of legislative approbation began in May 2016, the last reading of the\nParliament of New Zealand carried out in February, and the Crown gave formal assent to Te\nAwa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act on 20 March 2017. To date, there\nhave been three minor amendments, coming from the Trust Act (2019), the Public Service\nAct (2020), and the Education and Training Act (2020). However, none of them changed the\nessence of the law; they merely shifted some legal references.852\nAt first glance, the language of the legal text draws attention. Effectively, unlike other\ncases, the Parliament decided to incorporate the spirit of aboriginal believes in the letter of\nthe law. Interestingly, they did it in the very Maori language, in addition to English. As one\ncan imagine, there is no place to semantic interpretations of the terminology in here, not even\nin common parlance. Albeit one could see this idiomatic combination as a mere declarative\naspect, it seems to break down into two remarkable purposes: it boosts the social visibility\nof the indigenous cosmology about the Whanganui River ecosystem, and minimises the\nmisunderstanding about the contents of the law, especially among the Maori communities.853\nUnlike the previous case, there is no place to semantic interpretations of the terminology\nhere, not even in common parlance, mainly because the spirit of aboriginal believes has been\nincorporated to the letter of the law in the proper Maori language, in addition to English.\nOn the other hand, as Hutchison notices, the holistic conception of Te Awa Tupua ,\ncoming from the Waitangi Tribunal and the agreement with the Crown, seems quite close to\nthe ecocentric philosophies, chiefly regarding Earth Jurisprudence.854 This characteristic is",

Given that Te\nPou Tupua has full capacity and all the necessary powers to exercise its functions and duties,\nit performs as a kind of administrator in the strictest sense of the word.

Despite this vagueness, some\nauthors, such as Collins and Esterling, have questioned the lack of definition of property\nrights in favour of Māori people. For the authors, native ownership has constituted a\nhistorical claim under the Treaty of Waitangi. In any case, the field of action of Te Pou\nTupua allows thinking about a generalised restriction of ownership around the Whanganui\nRiver.859\nOn the contrary, the ideas concerning the river understood as a living entity that has\nlegal standing in its own right, following the exigencies of the agreement, are recurrent and\nentirely consistent with the ecocentric context. As mentioned, indivisibility, spirituality,\nuniqueness, singularity, among others, are characteristics related to the conceptualisation of\nTe Awa Tupua . It means the river is not an isolated individual, but rather, it deals with a\nbeing that forms part of a whole, of a greater ecosystem, Te Awa Tupua . Furthermore, unlike\nthe previous examples, the individualisation of the ecosystem around the river avoids the\nalluded abstractions, tougher to protect environmentally in practice.\nTo conclude, the explicit determination of duties constitutes a remarkable contribution.\nEffectively, for example, there is a complete section dedicated to the rules of taxation. Thus,\nthe first provision reads: “ Te Awa Tupua and Te Pou Tupua are deemed to be the same\nperson for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts and the liabilities and obligations placed\non a person under those Acts ”. This aspect is diverse from any other proposal to recognise\nthe legal personality of Nature and fit adequately with the idea of a subject of rights and\nobligations, according to the normative mainstream. Furthermore, the possibility of\nconceiving the ecosystem by exercising rights and accomplishing duties suggests the idea of\npeople working on their own benefit, welfare, enhancement of their living conditions, among\nother aspects. Indeed, Argyrou and Hummels also see this feature as a call for “ community\nentrepreneurship ” for the benefit, health, and wellbeing of the river.860\nIn that regard, although one has questioned the anthropocentric character of the\nconventional legislation worldwide, the fact that the new paradigms can adapt to the law,\ncurrently in force, implies a step forward in the challenge of recognising the rights of Nature.\nIt seems better to undergo a process of adaptation than attempting to impose new ways of\nthinking overnight.

    "text": "864 Translation of the Constitution of Bolivia (2009) Recital 6th.\nthe law does not bestow legal personality on Nature, under the conditions of the national\nlegislation.865\nOn their part, the tenets that govern the relationship between humans and Nature are\nharmony, collective welfare, warranty of generation of Mother Earth, respect and defence of\nits rights, no commodification, and interculturality. Likewise, the law recognises the\nfollowing rights: life, diversity of life, water, clean air, balance, restoration, and freedom\nfrom contamination. As a peculiarity, the law has created an ombudsperson to protect,\npromote, spread, and enforce the rights of Mother Earth.866\nTwo years later, the Legislative Assembly enacted the Framework Mother Earth Act for\nComprehensive Development to Live Well, aimed at establishing the vision and\nfundamentals of holistic development, in harmony and balance with the Mother Earth for\nliving well. It attempted warrantying the continuity of the capacity of regeneration of the\ncomponents and systems of life, recovering, and strengthening local wisdom and ancestral\nknowledge, within the framework of the complementarity of rights and duties.867\nNonetheless, when one scrutinises the contents of the law, it is noticeable a remarkable\nshift of orientation. For example, one can find references concerning the actions to promote\nthe use of goods and service to meet the basic needs of people, minimising the excessive\nexploitation of the components of Mother Earth. Likewise, the law tends to establish\nprocesses of production without pollutants, to facilitate the equate access to her components,\nor to democratise the access to the means or factors of production.868\nIn brief, this longer instrument includes some terminologies more associated with\nanthropocentric parlance than ecocentric one. For instance, one can find expressions like\nmarket, commerce, trade, sustainable exploitation, investments, sovereignty on food safety,\nand even property rights. In practice, the law provides the right of exploitation or use of the\n“products” coming from the components of the Mother Earth with commercial ends or\npublic interest. Moreover, it even promotes the industrialisation of her components and the\nactivities of mining and oil extraction. As Boyd appropriately points out, “[...] this second\nMother Earth law is fraught with contradictions ”869",

Moreover, during the last\nyears, Ganga River has experienced the ravages derived from overpopulation and pollution.\nIn a certain way, these aspects help to elucidate why was necessary a turning point in the\nmanner how Hindus have historically handled the rivers.870\nAware of the fact that Ganga River supports around 500 million people, the National\nGanga Rights Movement, join with other partners (such as Ganga Action Parivar, CELDF,\nand Action Aid India) began a campaign to promote the enactment of a National Ganga\nRights Act some years ago.

Firstly, the bestowal of legal personality on the rivers does not only imply the\ngranting of rights but also the establishment of obligations, which coherently fit with the\ncharacterisation of a legal person. This issue is not new for the Hindu juridical tradition.\nIndeed, the court quotes a 1969 Supreme Court decision, in which it held that “[...] a Hindu\nidol is a juristic entity capable of holding property and of being taxed through its Shebaits\nwho are entrusted with the possession and management of its property ”.874 Under similar\ncircumstances to what happened with the Whanganui River of New Zealand, one should\nargue this peculiarity assuredly endows more consistency to the recognition of rights.\nSecondly, the court settled the question of legal representation invoking the condition\nof the rivers as “ persons in loco parentis ”, another Latin expression literally meaning “ in the\nplace of a parent ”, usually employed or related to temporary guardians or caretakers of\nchildren, who take on all or some of the responsibilities of a parent. In this manner, the court\nentrusted the representation of the river to the three alluded public authorities, in order to\nprotect, conserve, and preserve the fluvial system, i.e., being their human face.875 By way of\ncomment, as already mentioned, the designation of someone who represents Nature (the\nrivers in this case) constitutes an adequate contribution in itself.

Colombia (2016) Antecedents 1, 5.14, 5.57, 6.3, and 6.6.\nUnder a similar logic, two years later, the Supreme Court declared the Colombian\nAmazon as a bearer of rights of protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration, in\ncharge of State and the territorial entities that form part of it. The lawsuit initially consisted\nof a legal guardianship, required by a group of children and youth (between 7 and 25 years\nold), as an endeavour to prevent the Amazon deforestation and to claim the respect of their\nright to a healthy environment. Unlike the Atrato River’s case, the claimants are now the\nguardians of the Amazon. Nevertheless, they must count on the government to elaborate and\nAction Plan to stop deforestation and consolidate the Intergenerational Pact for the Life of\nthe Colombian Amazon (PIVAC, in Spanish) in practice.882\nAlthough one should admit the granting of guardianship in favour of a group of\nindividuals, particularly children and youth, depicts the cutting edge in matters of rights, one\ncannot obviate the fact that both the action plan and the intergenerational pact impose a\ncertain dependence on the Colombian government, which constitutes a subtle way to\nobtruding the independence and autonomy of the defence of Nature. It turns out particularly\ncurious that the Ministry of Agriculture, the other member of the Pact, oversee an action plan\nto halt deforestation when it has been traditionally an institution dedicated to foster it.\nLikewise, the Administrative Tribunal of Boyacá declared Pisba Highlands ( páramo) as\na holder of rights, implying the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is\nresponsible for the legal representation. Nevertheless, property rights responded to a quite\ndifferent situation in comparison to what happened with the Atrato River’s case, because\nmining workers and other private landowners were claiming for their respective\nentitlements. Indeed, this ruling began with a lawsuit coming from a group of mining\nworkers, who required be part of the process of delimitation of Pisba Highlands. And,\nalthough they eventually lost the proceedings, the judgement proves there is a high level of\nsocial conflict into that area.883\nThe Pisba Highlands case entirely shows the crucial problem derived from any potential\nrecognition of rights of Nature, the strains between the transmutation of the legal character\nof natural resources and the maintenance of traditional property rights, including the\nexpectancies for economic profits coming as a result of productive activities (e.g., mining).\nIn other words, if Nature is not going to be a set of things anymore, but a subject of law,",

    "text": "The first research question of the present chapter somehow gathers the whole elements of\nanalysis addressed within these last pages, which implies that the responses to the other\nqueries also contribute to answering this one. As a reference, the question was: What aspects\nof the national laws in current force, by which Nature has been recognised as a holder of\nrights, would be useful for its international acknowledgement ?\nThe response turns around four fundamental ideas: property rights, entitlements, duties,\nand legal representation. All these components comprise the final proposal of regulation\nposed through this research. One should take into account, however, that all these themes\nhave already been a matter of analysis, with different intensity, throughout the whole\nresearch. Thus, the aim of this last subsection does not imply a large recapitulation of\nprevious definitions and conclusions. It deals only with a final summary of arguments\nratified by national experiences.\nIn this regard, the second question research referred to what happens with the legal\nconditions of property rights in the case of the bestowal of international legal personality\non Nature . The response should be emphatic. If Nature becomes an international legal\nperson, property rights on natural resources (including land) cannot maintain their status\nquo. The logic of transmutation from object to subject of law gets imposed over current\nlegality. Subjects possess objects, things, commodities, and so on. Subjects do not own other\nsubjects.\nThe granting of legal personality and the subsequent recognition of rights of Nature\nbrings about a tendency to vanish property rights. It will not occur overnight, as Professor\nCullinan has foretold, but it will gradually happen sooner or later. In a certain sense, all the\ngreat scholars knew it. Leopold, Berry, Stone, and Cullinan quickly understood it so that\nthey have addressed this issue either directly or indirectly.\nNevertheless, one should take into account that property rights would only fade if the\nconferral of legal personality automatically places legal persons on a level playing field. In\neffect, the law recognises that an entity is a holder of rights only in a specific legal\nrelationship (for example, the editorial office of a newspaper is a juristic entity in press\nlawsuits but it is not on the stock exchange or in the court of registration). Consequently, in\naccordance with the interests of Nature, one can preserve some forms of ownership. Thus, a\nparadigm shift would also take place in the universality of property rights. Another solution\nis that the forms of ownership are not equal, i.e., a distinction would be made between the\npublic and private property (also based on the objects that one can own), as it exists in several\ncountries (e.g., land, forest, or water).\nIn either event, one should comprehend the shifts on the regulations of property rights\nwould probably “ tend” to its disappearance, which does not mean they are going to fade\nunfailingly. There are societies better prepared to cope with a change of paradigms, such as\nindigenous peoples, for example. Indeed, their modality of property-in-community appears\nas an effective alternative of adaptation to a potential new pattern of social organisation. For\ninstance, the fact that everybody owns the soils and water subtly implies that nobody is the\nowner in practice. The concept entirely aligns to the ecocentric perspective: “ The water owns\nthe water; the land owns the land ”. As seen, this idea facilitates the management of the\nfluvial ecosystems in New Zealand, India, and Colombia, given the existence of native\npeoples as actors of the process.\nOn their part, Ecuador and Bolivia would count on the same advantage because both\ncountries possess an important indigenous population. However, their legal experiences\nseem to be quite more ambiguous. Their legislative systems opted to recognise the rights of\nNature in general instead of focussing on specific ecosystems, such as rivers, glaciers,\nhighlands, and so on. Indeed, one could criticise the idea of recognising the rights of the\nAmazon region in Colombia under similar reasons, i.e., the ambiguity that leads to\nuncertainty. If one cannot identify what the real scope of the recognition is, it is going to be\nawfully hard to determine the scope of protection.\nWithin this analysis, one should also consider the question of state sovereignty over\nnatural resources. As mentioned, sovereign management of the environment constitutes a\nkind of variable of property rights in favour of State. In this sense, countries cannot continue\nto handle the environment as their private property, prioritising the economic and\ndevelopmental benefits. Unlike property rights, sovereignty cannot tend to disappear\nbecause it could be a powerful ally to promote the administration of resources from an\necocentric perspective, based on the state capacity of enforcement.\nTo conclude, if the tendency of recognition of the rights of Nature continues to spread\nworldwide, it would be a great idea to think about the possible changes concerning the\nregulation of property rights, above all, because if there is no any modification in the manner\nhow humans administrate their ownership, the recognition of rights of Nature will only be a\nutopic whim or simply dead letter.\nThe third research question corresponds to the essence of a juridical person, i.e., what\nthe key rights and duties of Nature as an international subject of law would be. One could\ndivide the answer to this query in two parts. Hence, it would be adequate to firstly address\nthe entitlements and later the obligations. In this regard, the Declaration of the Rights of\nMother Earth, the Ecuadorian Constitution, and the Bolivian law constitute outstanding\nsources because they somehow imply a systematisation of the rights of Nature. In\nconsequence, according to the mentioned instruments, one could argue the main rights of\nNature are life, diversity of life, existence, integral respect, regeneration of its bio-capacity,\ncontinuation, maintenance, and regeneration of its vital cycles and processes, maintenance\nof its identity, integrity, water, clean air, integral health, freedom from contamination,\npollution, and toxic or radioactive waste, no modification of its genetic structure, restoration,\nand balance.\nOn the other hand, both the Whanganui River Act and the adjudication concerning the\nGanga River constitute accurate sources to determine what would be the duties of Nature, as\na subject of law. According to both experiences, the archetype of obligation derived from an\necosystem is the payment of taxes, based on the productive and economic activities that\npeople can carry out within those environments.\nBoth instruments are coherent in this matter. If those people whose subsistence depends\non a specific ecosystem seize the benefits, derived from the utilisation of natural resources,\nit turns out consistent be claimed a correlative obligation. In the end, people are not the legal\nowners of Nature. In principle, the ecosystem possesses itself. However, if humans, who are\nalso part of the ecosystem, obtain economic benefits, it would not be weird that they have to\ncontribute to society through the payment of taxes. Under these circumstances, the\nredistributive character of taxes correctly fit with the theoretical stances of a juridical person\nand its capacity to acquire legal duties.\nIn consequence, considering the existence of an administrative body, co-represented by\nState and people from the river banks, the model described within the Whanganui River Act\nwould seem to be the more realistic and adequate standard to warranty a healthy and\ncorrelative balance between rights and duties of Nature.\nThe fourth research question refers to one of the most remarkable characteristics of the\nacknowledgement of the rights of Nature, which consists of the “ legitimacy of\nrepresentation ”. It reads: Who would represent Nature as a subject of law in the\ninternational ambit? The best manner to answer this question is perhaps by means of the\ndiscard of options.\nThus, the representation of Nature’s interest should respond to a balance among the\npolitical, economic, and social powers exercised within the international arena. Starting from\nthe biggest organisations, it does not seem to be a good idea to count on new global or\nregional institutions to defend the rights of Nature because it would imply the redundant\ncreation of more bureaucracy through immense political and economic efforts. If the\ninternational entities, such as the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of\nAmerican States, and so on, have not been able to cease the environmental disaster through\ntheir enormous political legitimacy, acceptance, and power, it seems little probable that\nanother new organisation of similar peculiarities can do it.\nNevertheless, the inconvenience of creating new international or regional entities does\nnot mean what exists is useless. All the contrary, the role of the global entities is crucial as\nthe political platform where international instruments can be issued and implemented. For\nexample, the programme “ Harmony with Nature ” has been a good beginning to visualise the\nquestion of rights of Nature worldwide. One should be conscious that bargaining processes\nare slow, and one can only obtain results gradually, but the fact that the theme can be\nincluded in the U.N. agenda is already an advance.\nOn the other hand, although the States would appear to be the ideal political\norganisations to defend and represent the rights of Nature, the absence of total autonomy and\nindependence to implement eco-friendly measures of public policy could be a hindrance. As\nseen, most of the time, States have an obligation to foster economic development as a\nresponse to poverty and other associated social inequalities. Nevertheless, that kind of\neconomic development often contradicts any endeavour to protect, conserve, and preserve\nNature. This duality circumvents that States can orient their policies exclusively toward one\nside or another. If the society claims for public services of electricity, secure water,\ncommunications, and so on, or the countries have to promote the industries of oil or mining,\nit is going to be very difficult that public policies establish strong environmental restrictions\nto these activities in practice. States will have to defend those vested interests instead of\ngreen ones.\nIn that regard, however, States cannot be definitively isolated from the process. The\ndefence of the rights of Nature does require their effective and permanent presence, playing\ntheir traditional role, i.e., making new laws, enforcing existing laws, and executing them\nthrough the implementation of public policies. Granted that governments often are not able\nto represent the rights of Nature fully, but their intervention is unavoidable to regulate\nbehaviours and control harmful activities. Under specific circumstances, it is not maybe a\ngood idea they oversee the rights of Nature due to vested interests over environmental-highimpact activities. Still, State is probably the only institution that counts on the resources and\ncapacity to combat against the environmental disaster for the time being.\nOne additional aspect to consider is the geographical range of representation. In plain\nlanguage, the experiences of recognition of Nature as a bearer of rights have a twofold scope.\nOn the one hand, the Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth, the Ecuadorian Constitution,\nthe Bolivian law, and the Colombian adjudication concerning the Amazon region turn out\nvague because they do not refer to a particular ecosystem but the whole. It generates\ndifficulties, for example, to identify actors, determine the ambit of real protection, implement\npublic policy measures, and so forth.\nThe determination of a specific ecosystem would seem the most effective way to address\nthe recognition of the rights of Nature, as it happens in the Atrato, Whanganui and Ganges\nRivers, or Pisba highlands, Gangotri and Yamunotri glaciers, or the U.S. ecosystems. The\nsingularisation of every situation allows a major closeness between people and Nature,\nmaking feasible the communion alluded to by Thomas Berry.\nIn the middle of the state insufficiency to exercise the representation of Nature, the legal\nstructure of the ombudsperson arises as an interesting alternative. However, one should deem\nit cannot deal with an institutionalised form, coming from the global perspective because it\nwould imply to commit the same mistake alluded with regard to the international and\nregional entities, by duplicating the bureaucracy. The direct reference would be the structure\ndesigned within the Ecuadorian legislation, even the Bolivian one, which pertains to the orbit\nof the local regulations. Thus, if that ombudsperson, created at a local level, could participate\nwithin the international arena, and defend judicially to the different existing ecosystems.\nNature before international tribunals and courts, one could argue this option should, at least,\nbe thought.\nTo conclude, the best manner to assure the defence and protection of Nature probably\ncomprises the entrustment of the representation to any individual or organisation with\nenough capacity to carry out its defence before the international system of justice or depict\nits interests over the table of international negotiations. It could endow legitimacy to the\ndifferent processes, given those people or entities would enjoy autonomy and independence\nfor struggling in favour of Nature.\nFinally, to close the present chapter and the dissertation, a general research question was\nposed under the following terms: How feasible is it to confer international legal personality\non Nature, as an alternative instrument to cope with the environmental crisis? As a\nresponse, one should theoretically admit that it is possible to grant international legal\npersonhood to Nature. There is a scenery comprised of the international or regional entities,\nthere is the legal instrument (e.g., conventions, treaties, covenants, and so on), and there are\nthe conditions of crisis necessary to think about a shift of paradigm. There is probably a lack\nof political and economic will, which will be surely overcome if this legal alternative spreads\nworldwide. In any case, the recognition of the rights of Nature would respond preferably to\nthe following conditions:",

Indeed, it has also reportedly “[...] acquired a status\njuridically more important than originally intended, [having] been widely used, even by\nnational courts, as a means of judging compliance with human rights obligations under the\nU.N. Charter ”.885\nIn any event, the three of them are considered the foundational legal documents of\nhuman rights. As such, their sturdy orientation towards people’s benefit marks undoubtedly\ntheir anthropocentric character par excellence. The most evident sample of this humancentred bias could be probably illustrated through the conception of “ inherent dignity ”,\nwhich is often associated with different dimensions of human welfare, such as liberty, work,\nor education, for example. Indeed, the entire system of human rights derives expressly from\nthe idea of inherent dignity as its cradle of origin. Likewise, freedom, justice, and peace rely\non it, along with equal and inalienable rights of humanity.886\nMore specifically, although there is not any reference to the right to a healthy\nenvironment within the International Bill of Human Rights, the question of the inherent\ndignity appears recurrently as one of the ethical roots of other numerous international\nagreements. Moreover, it is usually mentioned in different academic ambits and analysed as",

It seems to be so, above all, if one ponders about\nits primary aim, which consists of facing the problem of climate change, an aspect of\nplanetary range and importance, whose impacts have been deemed inevitable for a long time\nago. The chief measure employed to cope with the effects of global warming has been\nusually the control of the global average temperature, establishing constraints to avoid its\nsignificant increase.892\nBy and large, a thought-provoking peculiarity of the Convention on Climate Change\nbears on the manner how the treaty tackles the notion of rights. If one takes pains to review\nthe usage of the term thoroughly, it is not as frequent as one could assume it is. Consequently,\nthere are only eight explicit references about different kinds of entitlements, including the\nright to a healthy environment. The others are comprised of rights to exploit natural\nresources, to promote sustainable development, to vote, and the concurrent exercise of those\nrights and the economic justification of actions against climate change.893 In sum, the overall\noutline of the instrument does not lean towards a rights-based approach.\nAccording to the information taken from the United Nations Treaty Collection, the\ninstrument has experienced four essential milestones in terms of amendments.894 The early\none-so-called Kyoto Protocol -corresponds to 1997, and it is considered the first world treaty\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions-this is the principal objective.895 The leading involved\ngreenhouse gases were Carbon dioxide (CO 2), Methane (CH 4), Nitrous oxide (N 2O),\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6).\nAnother noteworthy aim consisted of promoting sustainable development, through the\nimplementation of policies and measures, such as the enhancement of energy efficiency, the\nprotection and improvement of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, the promotion of\nsustainable agriculture, and so on. It finally came into effect on 16 February 2015.896\nAnother legal reform was proposed by Belarus concerning the inclusion of its quantified\nemission limitation or reduction commitment in 92%, applicable to itself, as an Amendment\nto Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol. It formed part of the second session of the Conference of",

However, it is not yet in force.897\nThirdly, a new proposal to modify the Kyoto Protocol occurred in 2012, in Doha, Qatar.\nThe text of the amendment involves two foremost changes. The first one comprised a new\nperiod of commitment, i.e., 2013-2020, and the second one consisted of the addition of\nNitrogen trifluoride (NF 3) to the list of Greenhouse gases, but only applicable for the second\ncommitment period. The rest of the changes revolve around calculations, adjustments, and\nso on. The Doha Amendment also includes an annexe regarding political declarations.\nNevertheless, it is neither yet in force.898\nFinally, the so-called Paris Agreement of 2015, in force since 2016, probably depicts\nthe most archetypal effort to cope with climate change, not only in terms of national\ncommitments to diminish the temperature but also in terms of participation. Thus, on the one\nhand, it turns out crucial the compromises to hold the increase in the global average\ntemperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts\nto limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Besides,\nit is interesting that both measures have been considered as mechanisms to promote\nsustainable development and alleviate poverty.899\nOn the other hand, speaking about participation, the signature of the Paris Agreement\nwas a real success. It was the first time that all nations, i.e., the 195 countries recognised by\nthe United Nations, made a “ common cause ” to combat climate change, adapt to its effects,\nand implement actions and investments to accomplish these ends.900 Maybe that is the reason\nfor its enormous media coverage and its vast political influence,901 as well as the world shock\nbrought about for the USA withdrawal in 2017.902 Perhaps, all these episodes succinctly\nepitomise the transcendence of this instrument. Moreover, one should argue it also\nemphasises the global debate about the environmental crisis, where prevails the discursive\nexchange of beliefs and disbeliefs over the scientific dimension or the social sphere.\nIn any case, despite a convention, four amendments (two in force), twenty-five\nconferences of the parties, countless meetings, and other procedures, one could hardly affirm",

The convention was initially opened for signature\non 5 June 1992, during the Rio Conference, and it finally entered into force one and a half\nyears later, on 29 December 1993.903\nDespite its green discourse at times, the convention’s overall intent does not only frame\nwithin the conservation of biodiversity.

The first one is the Cartagena Protocol on\nBiosafety, signed in 2000, which came into force in 2003, with the overall objective of\nadequately protecting biodiversity and human health, in case of transfer, handling, and\nutilisation of biotechnologically modified organisms, emphasising trans-boundary\nmovements. The second one is the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources, opened\nto signatures in 2010. It finally entered into effect in 2014. Its aim was the fair and equitable\nsharing of the benefits brought about the sustainable use, access, transfer of technology,\nrights over the resources, and adequate funding of genetic resources, as mechanisms to\nconserve biodiversity. And the last one is the Nagoya - Kuala Lumpur Supplementary\nProtocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol, whose primary purpose\nconsisted of providing international rules and procedures of liability and redress regarding\nliving modified organisms.

    "text": "Soft Law is a paradoxical expression, used to describe a process of normative creation,\nwhich is not mandatory in the international arena, at least in a conventional manner or\nbeyond its authoritative-often authoritarian-language. Sociologists address it as a\nphenomenon, structural in its development, diversified in its components, and rapid in its\nevolution, especially in regard to the increase of the world economy, the state\ninterdependence, and the progress of science and technology.915 Starting from Stockholm,\nthe U.N. declarations and resolutions are examples.\nFrom the United Nations perspective, the backgrounds of the connexion among human\nrights and environment are located mostly in two of the most prominent declarations of\nprinciples everybody knows. They are the Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations\nConference on the Human Environment (1972) and the Rio Declaration on Environment and\nDevelopment (1992).916\nThe Stockholm Declaration was the outcome of multiple attempts to promote the\ndiminution of the gap between environmental protection and economic growth.917 Indeed,\nthis dichotomy was being already debated through several works and events worldwide,\ncoming even to give rise to the very concept of “ sustainable development ”, popularised later\nby the Brundtland Report.918 Some experts consider the 1972-Conference on the Human\nEnvironment-the scenario where countries agreed the declaration’s contents-as the most\nsuccessful international event of those times. It is due to the adoption of institutional and\nfinancial arrangements, the commitment of an ambitious action plan, and an accord about\nshared principles to guide people towards the preservation and strengthening of the human\nenvironment.919\nOn its part, the 1992-Rio Declaration is much more than mere ratification of what\nnations agreed in Stockholm, even though there is an express reaffirmation of principles in\nthe first recital. The fact of having “[...] been endorsed by virtually every nation in the\nworld”, as David Boyd highlights, and quoted in practically all existing works about the\ntopic920 illustrates its global significance. Likewise, as mentioned by some authors, the\nchronicle concerning the negotiation of its title’s wording denotes its original envisions of",

For this reason, it will be enough to just quote the most\nnoticeable.\nThus, for example, it is undeniable the influence exerted in the international green\ndiscourse by works, such as “ Silent Spring ” (1962) or “ The Limits to Growth ” (1972).923\nLikewise, certain international events have also influenced the environmental field. In this\nregard, the Intergovernmental Conference of Experts on the scientific basis for the rational\nuse and conservation of the resources of the biosphere (1968), also known as “ The Biosphere\nConference ”, was the first international forum to discuss the notion of sustainable\ndevelopment, despite the fact that it was not the original aim. The conference was quite\nrelevant to the global debate of sustainable development, to the point of having laid the\nfoundations for the creation of the Program “ Man and Biosphere ”, just like UNESCO has\nrecognised.924\nAdditionally, prestigious agencies and researchers addressed topics regarding\ndevelopment programs and their consequences on health, nutrition, productivity, irrigation,\nenvironmental degradation, among others, in the Conference on the Ecological Aspects of\nInternational Development (1968). Lectures came out in the well-known work “ The\nCareless Technology ”.925 Indubitably, one should not set aside the documentation relating\nto the U.N. Secretary-General’s report: “ Problems of the Human Environment ” (E/4667),\nrequested by the U.N. General Assembly through the Resolution No. 2398 (XXIII). That\nwas the same instrument employed to summon what would be the Stockholm Conference .",

    "text": "In the main, the history of this conflict traces back to 16 September 1977, when Hungary\nand Czechoslovakia signed at Budapest the treaty and the agreement concerning mutual\nassistance in the construction and operation of the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros System of Locks.\nThe project also included the building of head-water installations, flood-control works,\ndams, a bypass canal, a hydroelectric plant, and works on the bed of the Danube River, as a\njoint investment. According to the treaty, the initial idea consisted of attaining the “[...]\nbroad utilization of the natural resources of the Bratislava-Budapest section of the Danube\nriver for the development of water resources, energy, transport, agriculture and other\nsectors of the national economy of the Contracting Parties ”.926\nThe works started in 1978. Hungary undertook the construction in the sector of\nNagymaros, located in a narrow valley at a bent of the Danube River. On its part,\nCzechoslovakia, whose territory got finally split into two independent countries in 1993-\nSlovakia and the Czech Republic-began to build in Gabčíkovo, a location in the left bank of\nthe river, in Slovak territory. Eventually, Slovakia took over both the treaty and the\nconstruction.927\nDespite a couple of changes regarding the comprehensive schedule, one in 1983 and\nanother in 1989928, the construction continued as usual. During 1989, however, the\nHungarian government decided to suspend the works at Nagymaros and Dunakiliti, arguing\na “state of ecological necessity ”. According to Hungary, the foremost environmental risk\nderived from the project consisted of the potential impacts on the quality of water. The\nresidual discharges into the bed of the Danube River could affect the ecosystem, bringing\nabout mainly eutrophication and placing flora and fauna in jeopardy.929\nFurthermore, Hungary claimed the breach of the Treaty in regard to water quality and\nenvironmental protection. One of the alluded provisions thereon lays down that the",

Likewise, the Treaty established that both countries\nshould “[...] ensure compliance with the obligations for the protection of nature arising in\nconnection with the construction and operation of the System of Locks ”.930\nAs mentioned by Fred Pearce, Hungarian biologists mainly “[...] worried that the dams\nwould damage both the treasured scenery of the Danube Bend and the underground water\nreserves on which more than a million Hungarians depend ”. The ICJ somehow shared this\nargument or, at least, was conscious of it, pointing out the severe disapproval generated in\nHungary concerning the construction.931\nOn its part, Slovakia began the construction of an alternative solution for the Gabčíkovo\nproject, so-called “ Variant C ”, in 1991. It entailed a unilateral diversion of the Danube-\nlocated around ten kilometres upstream of Dunakiliti-, the construction of an overflow dam\nat Cunovo, and a levee linking that dam to the south bank of the bypass canal. The country\nput the installation into operation in 1992.932\nDuring this period, some negotiations took place between the parties, although\nunsuccessfully. Indeed, the fruitless bargaining, as Marcel Szabo observes, continued until\nthe first decade of the twenty-first-century, chiefly due to the different strategies employed\nby the parties. Thus, while Hungary considered that “ the facilities not constructed were not\nrequired to be built ”, Slovakia “[...] underlined that the main goal of the negotiations was\nthat every necessary measure had to be adopted with the view to achieving all the goals of\nthe 1977 Treaty ”.933\nOn 19 May 1992, Hungary notified the termination of the 1977-CzechoslovakiaHungary Treaty, arguing “[...] the existence of a state of necessity; the impossibility of\nperformance of the Treaty; the occurrence of a fundamental change of circumstances; the\nmaterial breach of the Treaty by Czechoslovakia; and, finally, the development of new norms\nof international environmental law ”.934\nEventually, on 2 July 1993, both nations agreed to submit a letter to the ICJ, which\ncontained three questions undergone to the decision of the Court. Firstly, both parties asked\nif Hungary was entitled to suspend and abandon the project in 1989. Secondly, they also",

The ICJ also concluded that both\nparties had to negotiate in good faith the achievement of the Treaty’s aims.

Cann abisremainsthemost commonly\nused illicit drug worldwide, with an estimated 209 million c onsumers in 2020, reﬂecting a\n23%increaseoverthelastdecade. Thisisfollowedbyopioid s(61million), amphetamines(34\nmillion), cocaine(21million), andecstasy (20million)( UNODC ,2022). For decades, several\ncountries have entered thedebate onthelegalization of mar ijuana. Inthispaper, weprovide\na new methodology for examining the consequences of legaliz ing marijuana, which helps to\nanswer questions regarding its access, and extensive and in tensive margins. Therefore, we\ncan have a better understanding on: how much the prevalence a nd intensity of marijuana\nuseriseunderlegalization?, isthereheterogeneity inres ponsetolegalization amongdiﬀerent\nage groups?, and could government policies based on taxatio n and campaigns about risk\nperception be eﬀective in curbing use?\nWe extend Jacobi and Sovinsky (2016)’s proposal, who proposed two independent twopart models to study the extensive and intensive margins of m arijuana demand taken into\naccount access restrictions when modeling demand for illic it drugs in Australia. In particular, we propose an endogenous three-part model that simult aneously takes into account\naccess, extensive and intensive margins, as well as inciden tal truncation. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper to estimate demand for a n illicit drug that considers simultaneously these features. Taking into account acc ess restrictions is relevant as\nillicit drugs are not as easy to ﬁnd, thus non-users have litt le information about how to get\nmarijuana, which is a necessary condition to becoming a user (Jacobi and Sovinsky ,2016).\nTruncation is also relevant when modeling demand for illici t drugs as individuals tend to\nwithhold information about their use ( Lloyd,2013). We apply our methodological proposal\nto model the demand for marijuana in Colombia, and study the p otential implications of\nthe legalization of marijuana in this market, where marijua na is decriminalized, making\ndiﬀerent counterfactual exercises trying to respond releva nt inquiries regarding marijuana\nlegalization. Colombian market is signiﬁcant as this is one of the world’s main producers\nof marijuana ( UNODC ,2021), resulting in relatively easy access and low prices.\nFor decades, countries have faced pressures regarding the d ecision to decriminalize or\nlegalize the marijuanamarket. It is important to note that c ountries can implement a policy\nof liberalizing the marijuana market through either full le galization or decriminalization.\nAccording to Nkansah-Amankra and Minelli (2016), legalization occurs when authorities\napprove the use of a substance previously prohibited by law, thereby eliminating the risk of\narrest or ﬁnes. Decriminalization suspends criminal sanct ions for using or possessing a particular substance; however, it maintains the substance’s i llegal status, allowing for potential\npunishment through civil ﬁnes, education, social work, and other measures. Uruguay was\nthe ﬁrst country to legalize recreational marijuana in 2013 ; some US states have also done\nso, as well as Canada in 2018 ( Jacobi and Sovinsky ,2016).\nThe literature highlights that the use of illicit drugs enta ils high costs for society, such\nas pressure on health systems, productivity loss ( Van Ours ,2006), delinquency, violence\n(Norstr¨ om and Rossow ,2014), incarceration and costs of the criminal justice system, e ducational performance, child abuse, and corruption, among others (MacCoun et al. ,1996;\nWen et al. ,2014). There is also evidence that fewer young people consider ca nnabis consumptiondangerous,whichleadstothenormalizationofcon sumptionbehavior( J¨ arvinen and Demant ,\n2011). Additionally, there is the hypothesis that the legalizat ion or decriminalization of\nmarijuana serves as an incentive for consumption for younge r populations since the early\nonset of cannabis use substantially increases subsequent c onsumption rates ( Pudney,2004).\nThis scenario implies that it is not easy for countries to dec ide to liberalize the market.\nStudies that show post-legalization eﬀects, such as those of Rubin-Kahana et al. (2022) and\nRoﬀman (2016), suggest that some negative repercussions may not manifes t until 5 or 10\nyears later, and the same applies to positive impacts.\nThose in favor of marijuana legalization argue for a reducti on in violence generated\nby the illegal market ( Donohue III et al. ,2010), as well as a decrease in the cost of law\nenforcement (police and judiciary), a reduction in arrests (Roﬀman,2016).Mace et al.\nalso speak about tax revenue that could beneﬁt from legaliza tion for the United States,\nCanada, and Australia, with funds allocated to education, s ports, and other addiction programs. On the issue of taxation, Miron(2005) also provides insights. Those who oppose\nlegalization refer to the negative aspects of legalization , such as the possibility of a price\ndecrease due to the elimination of transaction costs associ ated with illegality ( Becker et al. ,\n2006). Another relevant aspect is the potency of cannabis and its psychoactive component, which can have increasingly harmful consequences for health, including mental health\nproblems ( ElSohly et al. ,2016;Van Ours ,2006).\nThus, there is evidence of increased hospitalizations and i ntoxications due to excessive\nmarijuana consumption post-legalization ( Roﬀman,2016;Rubin-Kahana et al. ,2022), as\nwell as psychotic and mental health eﬀects ( Moran et al. ,2022). Studies show an increase\nin consumption due to legalization in the United States. The most recent ones, such as that\nofMennis et al. (2023), show that after the legalization of recreational marijua na, there\nwas an increase in consumption, especially among teenagers . Additionally, researchers have\nfound an increased frequency of marijuana use and a higher pr evalence of symptoms associated with marijuana use disorder ( Kilmer et al. ,2022).Barker and Moreno (2021) found\nthat legalization had more signiﬁcant direct eﬀects on those who were already marijuana\nconsumers, surrounded by an increasingly favorable climat e for consumption.\nThe Canadian case ( Rotermann ,2020) shows similar results, where the increase in\nconsumption is mainly associated with men over 25 years old. However, it is essential to\nnote that individuals between 15 and 17 years old are experie ncing a decrease. At the\nsame time, the prevalence of consumption remains stable, an d there is a decrease in the\nacquisition of marijuana from illegal sources. Rubin-Kahana et al. (2022) found diﬀerent\nsources with conﬂicting data for Canadian teenagers, some s tudies report an increase, but\nmost do not show a pronounced increase, demonstrating ambig uity in the analysis. In the\ncase of Uruguay, Laqueur et al. (2020) sought to study the eﬀect of legalization on high\nschool students in Montevideo and regions within the countr y after legalization, but found\nnoevidence of an impact on cannabis consumption or perceive d consumption risk. However,\nthey did ﬁnd an increase in student perception of cannabis av ailability after legalization.\nIn addition to the above, polydrug use, which involves the co mbination of several substances, has become more visible. Regarding this, the most c ommon combination in the\nAmericas is that of cannabis with stimulants (such as cocain e and ecstasy), followed by opioids with stimulants, and ﬁnally, cannabis with opioids. Th e growing trend of polydrug use\nposes signiﬁcant risks to consumers due to the interaction b etween substances ( UNODC ,\n2022), constituting an essential topic on the global public agen da. Furthermore, since the\n1970s, the question has arisen as to whether access to mariju ana leads to an increase in\nthe use of other more problematic substances, with the so-ca lled “gateway hypothesis”\n(DeSimone ,1998;Kandel,1975). Regarding this, Kandel et al. (1992) argue that the progression to more toxic drugs depends on prior use of cigarett es or alcohol, then marijuana,\nand then moreharmfulsubstances. Among thenew trendsin con sumption arean expansion\nin the forms of use and more potent products ( Hammond et al. ,2021;Rubin-Kahana et al. ,\n2022). Furthermore, researchers ( Guttmannova et al. ,2021;Kim et al. ,2021) discovered\na positive association between the frequency of cannabis an d alcohol consumption. Additionally, ( Weinberger et al. ,2022) established a positive relationship between marijuana\nconsumption and frequency among tobacco users.\nFinally, diﬀerent studies have attempted to estimate the pri ce elasticity of marijuanademandintheUS,ﬁndingthatitisinelastic( Davis et al. ,2016;Kilmer et al. ,2014;Grossman ,\n2005;Nisbet and Vakil ,1972), ranging from -0.69 to -0.26. Researchers conducted the sa me\nexercise inothercountries, suchas SouthAfrica, Thailand andAustralia, andfoundthat demandinthosecountriesisalsoinaninelasticrange( Riley et al. ,2020;Sukharomana and Chang ,\n2017;Van Ours and Williams ,2007).Gallet(2014) observed that marijuana demand shows\nless responsiveness to prices than other drugs.\nOur results suggests that selection into access is relevant for the intensive margin conditional in the extensive margin, and that modeling simultane ously the three stages is important. We found that marijuana is an inelastic good (the avera ge elasticity is -0.45), there is\nnot statistically signiﬁcance regarding price heterogene ity among age groups, and the risk\nperception about its use is also not relevant on the intensiv e margin, but it is very relevant\nin the access and extensive margin. Moreover, we did not ﬁnd h eterogeneity regarding age\nsplines in the intensive margin, but there is also relevant h eterogeneity regarding the access\nand extensive margin. In general, we found that demographic and socioeconomic features\nare important to explain the three stages of marijuana deman d in Colombia, all parameters\nestimates give intuitive results, for instance, women have less probability of having access\nand using marijuana, and their consumption is 45.5% lower th an consumption of men.\nRegarding the counterfactual exercises, we found that lega lization of marijuana implies\nan overall increase of the probability of use in 0.7 percenta ge points (p.p.), from 2.3% prelegalization to 3.0% under legalization. The population gr oup that faces the higher increase\nin the probability of consumption is younger individuals (2 0s age spline) with a low or\nmedium risk perception about using marijuana, this is 3.8 p. p., from 13.6% to 17.4%. In\naddition, tax revenues from taxation to marijuana may ﬂuctu ate between USD 11.0 million\nto USD 54.2 million, this depends on the tax setting. A potent ial benchmark is USD 32\nmillion, where marijuana tax is US ¢37.8, which implies a price equal to US ¢39.1, half the\nprice of actual marijuana for individuals with access.\nAfter this introduction, we show our econometric framework in Section 2. Section 3\nshows the results of the demand of marijuana in Colombia usin g information from the\nNational Survey on the Consumption of Psychoactive Substan ces in 2019. Section 4shows\nresults of tests regarding exclusionary restrictions and s ome robustness checks. Section\n5shows results of potential implications of marijuana legal ization on the extensive and\nintensive margins, and potential revenues that the governm ent would have from this public\npolicy. Concluding remarks are shown in Section 6.\n2 Econometric approach\n2.1 Drug access\nWe setAimindicating if individual iin market mhas access to marijuana,\nAim=\n\n1, Ua\nim>0\n0, Ua\nim≤0\n\n, (1)\nim=w⊤\niαa+oiτa+ωa+dimβa+Vimis the access latent variable, i= 1,...,N,\nm= 1,...,M.\nEquation 1deﬁnes if individual ihas access to marijuana in market m(Aim= 1), or\nnot (Aim= 0), if she/he has a net positive utility from it. The latter i s a function of\nsocioeconomic and demographic characteristics ( wi) such as age splines (teenager or 20’s,\n30’s, 40’s, and 50’s or older), socioeconomic strata (low, m edium and high), years of education, gender, mental and physical health status (good or bad ), a dummy variable indicating\nif friends or family members use marijuana, and risk percept ion about using marijuana\n(low, medium and high). The latter variable is associated wi th mental, physical or/and\nsocial risks. There is no legal risk for marijuana users in Co lombia as it is legally allowed\nthe personal dose of regular cannabis (up to 20 grams). The ri sk perception is potentially\ninﬂuenced by the public policy, as marketing campaigns may a ﬀect risk perception about\nmarijuana use. We also control for a dummy variable indicati ng previous consumption of\nalcohol and cigarette ( oi), characteristics of the market such regional-ﬁxed eﬀects ( ωa), and\npresence of drug dealers in the neighborhood ( dim). The latter is a supply side variable\nthat should aﬀect access to marijuana. The location paramete rs areαa,ωaandβa, and we\nassumeVim∼N(0,1), where the variance is set to 1 due to scale identiﬁcation i ssues.\n2.2 Drug extensive margin\nim=w⊤\niαc+ωc+oiτc+Eimdeﬁnes drug use (extensive margin),\nCim=\n\n1, Uc\nim>0|Aim= 1\n0, Uc\nim≤0|Aim= 1\n−, A im= 0\n\n. (2)\nWe observe if individual iuses marijuana in market m(Cim= 1), or not ( Cim= 0).\nIndividuals use marijuana if they have a net positive utilit y from it, conditional on having\naccess (Aim= 1). Otherwise, individuals do not use marijuana if they do n ot have a net\npositive utility from it conditional on having access. Obse rve that we have missing values\nregarding consumption when individuals do not have access t o marijuana. This is due to\nindividuals without access may or may not have net positive u tility from marijuana use,\ntherefore, we do not have information about their potential preferences, and consequently,\nthis set of individuals do not contribute to identify these p arameters.\nThe net indirect utility deﬁning drug use depends on demogra phic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics ( wi), regional-ﬁxed eﬀects ( ωc), and a dummy indicating previous consumption of alcohol and cigarette ( oi). The latter variable is due to the gateway hypothesis which\nindicates that previous consumption of these legal substan ces precedes use of illicit drugs\n(Kandel,1975;Kandel et al. ,1992). Observe that we do not use price of marijuana in the\nextensive margin equation as due to its low price in Colombia (US¢83 per joint), this variable should not aﬀect the extensive margin. We assume that Eim∼N(0,1) due to scale\nidentiﬁcation issues, and the location parameters are αc,ωcandτc.\n2.3 Drug intensive margin\nWe model the consumption quantity (intensive margin), as a f unction of socioeconomic and\ndemographic characteristics ( wi), regional-ﬁxed eﬀects ( ωy), price of marijuana ( pi), and\nthe interaction between price and age brackets ( wAge(j)\ni×pi, where Age(j) refers to j-th age\nbracket). The latter due to potential heterogeneity regard ing price sensitivity among age\nsplines. Observe that we have prices at individual level wei ghted by quality (see Appendix\nAsectionsA.1andA.2), this implies that endogeneity would not be a concern due to there\nis no demand-supply simultaneity neither endogeneous vari ation in the stochastic error due\nto quality of marijuana ( Jacobi and Sovinsky ,2016).\nWe consider in the intensive margin equation incidental tru ncation, that is, there are\nmissing values for consumption quantity when individuals d o not have access, or having\naccess reporting not to use marijuana.\nYim=\n\nw⊤\niαy+ωy+piγy+/summationtextJ\nj=1wAge(j)\ni×piγyj+Wim, C im= 1\n− Cim= 0 orAim= 0\n\n.(3)\nObservethatthetruncationsettinggiveninequation 3, aswearenottakingintoaccount\nzero consumption.

(4)\nObserve that if Σis a diagonal matrix, the three stages are independent, and w e can\nperform inference estimating each equation separately. Th is maybe a situation where there\nis no strategic search of drug dealers by users, and that more intense consumers do not\nmake a greater eﬀort to get drug dealers when arriving to a new m arket. On the other\nhand, if there is endogenous access, which means σca/ne}ationslash= 0 and/or σya/ne}ationslash= 0, we should\nmodel simultaneously these equations to get good sampling p roperties of our estimators.\nIn addition, σyctakes into account potential unobserved dependence betwee n extensive and\nintensive margins conditional on selection into access.\n2.5 Estimation strategy\nObserve that modeling the joint distribution of access, ext ensive and intensive margin implies to integrate over a multivariate space to recover the l ikelihood function. In addition,\nthis is not a standard likelihood as incidental truncation i mplies that diﬀerent sets of individuals contribute to diﬀerent sets of parameters. Partic ularly, there are three diﬀerent\ngroups of individuals when taking the model setting given by equations 1,2and3: all\nindividuals ( G1) contribute to estimate the location parameters in the acce ss equation, individuals who report having access ( G2) contribute to estimate the location parameters in\nthe extensive margin equation and σac, and individuals who report to use marijuana ( G3)\ncontribute to estimate the parameters of the intensive marg in equation, and σay,σcyand\nσ2\ny.\nThus, we use data augmenting ( Tanner and Wong ,1987) to facilitate inference, we treat\nlatent variables as parameters, such that the augmented mod el is,\n\nUa\nim\nUc\nim\nYim\n\n/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright\nTim=\nxa⊤\nim0 0\n0xc⊤\nim0\n0 0 xy⊤\nim\n\n/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright\nXim\nθa\nθc\nθy\n\n/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright\nθ+\nVim\nEim\n\n/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright\nΞim, (5)\nwherexs⊤\nimis the vector of regressors associated with individual iin market min stage\ns={access, consumption, quantity }, andθsis the vector of location parameters in stage s.\np(˜T1,...,˜Tn|˜X1,...,˜Xn,θ,Σ) =G/productdisplay\ns=1/productdisplay\ni∈Gs{1(Aim= 0)1(Ua\nim≤0)+1(Aim= 1)1(Ua\nim>0)\n×[1(Cim= 0)1(Uc\nim≤0)+1(Cim= 1)1(Cc\nim>0)]}\n×φ(˜Ti|˜Xim˜θGs,˜ΣGs), (6)\nwhereG= 3,φ(·|˜Xim˜θGs,˜ΣGs) is the density function of a normal distribution with\nmean˜Xim˜θGsand variance ˜ΣGs, and˜M=f(Gs,M), where f(Gs,M) is a function that\ntakes as inputs a state ( Gs) and a matrix ( M), and returns as outputthe appropriate subset\nof rows and columns of M.

(7)\nWe implement our Gibbs sampling algorithm using standard co njugate independent\npriors to obtain standard conditional posterior distribut ions that facilitate computation. In\nparticular, we assume that π(θ,Ω) =N(θ|θ0,Θ0)×π(Ω|R0,r0), that is, a multivariate\nnormal distribution for the location parameters and an inve rse Wishart distribution for\nthe unidentiﬁed covariance matrix.

In particular, we fol low a simultaneous threepart modeling approach that takes into account that access i s a necessary condition for\nuse, such that the latter is endogenously determined with ex tensive and intensive margins.\nWe also incorporate that use is a necessary condition for the intensive margin, and allow\nfor unobserved correlation between these stages. In additi on, we consider the incidental\ntruncation issue due to missing reports when individuals re port no to have access to marijuana, or when reporting access, they report not to use it. O mitting access restrictions,\npotential correlation on unobservable variables and/or in cidental truncation may generate\ninconsistent estimators. There is also a clear link between our modeling strategy and the\npolicy that we want to analyze, as marijuana legalization im plies basically free access for all\npotential users, such that the “breaking the law” hindrance will disappear, this is formally\nP(AimM= 1) = 1inoureconometricframework, andwillbethebasisfor ourcounterfactual\nexercises.\n3 Marijuana demand in Colombia\n3.1 Data\nWe applyourapproach to theproblemof estimating thedemand formarijuanainColombia.\nWe leveraged individual-level data on the consumption of ps ychoactive substances representative of the entire country in 2019. In particular, our data come from the National Survey\non the Consumption of Psychoactive Substances ( ENCSPA 2019), which is a national representative survey, performed by the government statistical department of Colombia (DANE)\naiming to measure both legal and illegal substance abuse wit hin the population. The survey\nrandomly sampled households from several municipalities i n Colombia. It targeted individuals between 12 and 65 years of age, who were selected randoml y from all the household\nmembers that met the age criterion. The enumerators private ly performed the survey. If\nthe chosen person was absent during the survey, the enumerat or should return later but\nwas not allowed to change the individual to be interviewed.\nWe are especially interested in variables describing marij uana consumption patterns\nbased on theliterature review and data availability. Ourme asureof marijuanaconsumption\ntakes into account quality based on the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content (see Appendix\nA, subsection A.1). In addition, we use a nearest neighbor algorithm to impute prices\nfor those individuals who report not to consume marijuana, a nd consequently, who do not\nreport average price (see Appendix A, subsection A.2),1and a basic counting algorithm to\nconstruct risk perception about drug use (see Appendix A, subsection A.3).\nTable1presents the summary statistics for the key variables in our sample. We consider\nthree diﬀerent outcome variables, one for each part of the thr ee-part model: First, whether\nthe individual has access or not to marijuana by reporting th at it would be easy for her/him\nto get it. Second, whether the individual is a consumer, spec iﬁcally if they had consumed\nmarijuana during the last 12 months, and ﬁnally, the quantit y of marijuana consumed on\naverage permonth. Thequantity consumedismeasuredinthen umberof cigarettes or joints\nof marijuana; although it is not speciﬁed the number of grams , there is some consistency in\nthe sizes of common joints, which are usually about 1 gram.\nOur sample population consists of 49,414 individuals. Less than 60% report having\naccess (row 1, column 1); of those reporting having access, a pproximately 4% report consuming marijuana during the last 12 months (row 2, column 3). Finally, the consumers take\n23 joints of marijuana per month on average, with an average p rice of USD 0.84 (rows 3 and\n6, column 5). By deﬁnition, and aiming to achieve consistenc y in the model, individuals\nwho are consumers should have access; this is internally con sistent in the data for more\nthan 98% of the population and manually inputted for the rema ining 2%2The represen1Observe that posterior estimates of our model composed by equa tion1,2and3does not require\nthese prices.\n2We replace access equal to one if the person is a consumer for two m ain reasons. First, it is not\nintuitive for people who are current users to report that they can not get marijuana so it is likely\nan error in responding on the part of these individuals or misreportin g due to stigma. Second, for\nthe model to be internally consistent by construction, all users mu st have access. To review possible\nchanges to the deﬁnition of the access measure, we conducted mu ltiple exercises to validate the\nrobustness of the results.\ntative individual in the survey is a female with complete sec ondary education in her 20s\nliving in a low socioeconomic stratum. More than half of the p eople are workers, almost\n80% report having good mental health and 77% report having go od physical health, 91%\nhave a high-risk perception of the use of marijuana, and 36% r eport having a peer (family\nor friend) who is a consumer of marijuana. Approximately, 38 % of the sample declares to\nhave a drug dealer in the neighborhood, and 32% report to have consumed alcohol and\ncigarette.\n3.2 Model results\nWe performinference of the model in system 5running6,000 iterations with a burn-in equal\nto 1,000 and a thin parameter equal to 5, thus we have 1,000 eﬀec tive posterior draws. We\ncompute several diagnostics to assess the convergence and s tationarity of the posterior\nchains. In general, the posterior chains look good. Particu larly, all location parameters\nhave dependence factors that are less than 5, actually most o f them less than 2, using\nRaftery et al. (1992)’s diagnostic, with a 95% probability of obtaining an estim ate in the\ninterval 2 .5%±1.0%. Regarding Heidelberger and Welch (1983)’s andGeweke(1992)’s tests\nat 5% signiﬁcance level, all parameter estimates pass the fo rmer test, and 147 out of 163\nlocation parameters passed the latter test. The former uses the Cramer-von-Mises statistic\nto test the null hypothesis that the sampled values come from a stationary distribution,\nand the latter tests for equality of the posterior means usin g the ﬁrst 10% and the last 50%\nof the Markov chains. Regarding the scale parameters, we hav e that all parameters have a\ndependence factor less than 5, and one out of 4 does not passed the conventional values of\ntheHeidelberger and Welch (1983) andGeweke(1992) diagnostics.\nTable2reports the posterior estimates. Columns labeled univaria te show the posterior\nresults of estimating univariate models, that is, probit mo dels for the access and exten19\nsive margin equations, and a linear model for the logarithm o f marijuana consumption\n(intensive margin). Columns labeled multivariate show the posterior results of modeling\nsimultaneously equations 1,2and3taking into account truncation.\nWe observe that univariate and multivariate models give sim ilar results regarding the\naccess and extensive margin equations. This is due to Table 3suggesting that these two\nequations are exogenous. However, we observe in Table 2that posterior estimates of the\nunivariate andmultivariate modelsare diﬀerent regardingt heintensive margin (see columns\nintensive margin. In particular, Table 3indicates that the unobserved co-variation between\nthese equations is statistically signiﬁcant. This suggest s that conditional on the extensive\nmargin, more frequent marijuana consumers make higher eﬀort to have access to this drug.\nColumns (1) and (4) in Table 2show that having a drug dealer in the neighborhood\nincreases the probability of having access to marijuana. In particular, the probability of\nhaving access to marijuana for the representative individu al based on the descriptive statistics (see the last paragraph of the previous subsection) inc reases by 16.9 percentage points\ndue to presence of drug dealer in the neighborhood, that is, f rom 36.5% to 53.4%, given\nthe results in column (4). In addition, the probability of ha ving access is lower for women,\nindividuals who declare to have good mental health status, a nd are older. On the other\nhand, individuals who live in a low socioeconomic stratum, h ave a high or medium risk perception about marijuana use, who have more years of educatio n, friends or family members\nthat consume marijuana, and work, have a higher probability of having access to this drug.\nWe observe in columns (2) and (5) in Table 2that previous consumption of alcohol\nand cigarette increases the probability of consumption. Th is is evidence for the gateway\ndrug hypothesis. In addition, the probability of use increa ses with socioeconomic strata and\nhaving friends or family members who also consume. On the oth er hand, the probability\nof use decreases with age, risk perception, being female, ha ving good mental health and\nbeing a worker. The results in Table 2allows to predict the potential signiﬁcant eﬀects\nof a public policy that increases the risk perception about u sing marijuana. For instance,\nthe posterior estimates in column (5) indicates that the pro bability of using marijuana is\nequal to 40.5% for a man in his 20s that works, who has 12 years o f education, consumes\nalcohol and cigarettes, lives in a low socioeconomic stratu m, whose mental and physical\nhealth status is good, has friends who consume marijuana and has a low risk perception\nabout using marijuana. On the other hand, this probability i s equal to 15.2% for the same\nindividual, except that his risk perception about marijuan a use is high, that is, there is a\ndecrease of 25.3 percentage points due to changing the risk p erception.\nColumns (3) and (6) in Table 2show that the marijuana is an inelastic good. Particularly, column (6) shows that this elasticity is on avera ge equal to -0.45, and is statistically signiﬁcant; this agrees with previous literatu re (Gallet,2014;Davis et al. ,2016;\nSukharomana and Chang ,2017;Riley et al. ,2020). We also observe in this column that\nthere is not statistically signiﬁcant heterogeneity regar ding price sensitivity between age\ngroups. This is relevant from a public policy perspective as a valid concern regarding\nmarijuana legalization is the implications of price variat ions on young individuals. The\nmultivariate setting also suggests that the eﬀect of risk per ception is through the extensive\nmargin, rather than directly on the intensive margin, as is s uggested by the univariate modeling framework. This is, conditional on the extensive marg in, the risk perception does not\nhave any eﬀect on theintensive margin. Finally, wesee that on eadditional year ofeducation\ndecreases marijuana consumption by 6.9%, and women consume 45.5% (exp( −0.607)−1)\nless than men, whereas having a network where some individua ls consume marijuana increase marijuanaconsumptionby85.7% (exp(0 .619)−1). All thesevariables arestatistically\nsigniﬁcant.\n4 Statistical checks\n4.1 Exclusionary restrictions\nIt is well known that we can achieve identiﬁcation of causal e ﬀects in nonlinear models without exclusion restrictions ( McManus ,1992). However, exclusion restrictions improve inferenceduetoreducingvariabilityofestimatesbecauseofdat avariability( Munkin and Trivedi ,\n2003). We exclusively use presence of drug dealers in the neighbo rhood in the access equation as this variable aﬀects drug supply which helps to identi fy demand parameters. Particularly, we would expect that presence of drug dealers would p ositively aﬀect the probability\nof an individual having access to marijuana. We argue that th e eﬀect of this variable on\nthe extensive and intensive margins should be just through t he access.\nHowever, if this supply side variable aﬀects directly the net utility of using marijuana,\nthen our exclusion restriction would not be valid. We try to t est this restriction using the\nsubset of individuals who were oﬀered marijuana, as a consequ ence, they do not have to\nsearch for this drug, which means that they are relatively fr ee of the selection issue. We\ncheck the statistical signiﬁcance of this supply side varia ble running a probit model on\nthe access equation in this subsample. Column 1 of Table 4shows the posterior results\nusing a non-informative normal prior distribution, the num ber of iterations of the Gibbs\nsampler is 6,000, a burn-in equal to 1,000, and a thin paramet er equal to 5. We observe\nthat the presence of drug dealer is not statistically signiﬁ cant in the extensive margin\nequation. Hence, this result suggests that “drug dealer in n eighborhood” has validity as an\nexclusionary restriction.\nWe do not use presence of drug dealer in the neighborhood neit her if an individual has\nconsumed alcohol and cigarettes any time in her/his life in t he intensive margin equation.\nThegateway drug hypothesis would support the latter variable as pattern of legal substa nce\nuse would precede the use of illicit substances ( Kandel,1975;Kandel et al. ,1992). This\nmeans that individuals who have consumed substances like al cohol and nicotine would\nhave a higher probability of accessing and using marijuana. However, past or present\nconsumption of these substances should not directly aﬀect th e intensive margin. Column\n2 of Table 4shows the posterior results of estimating the intensive mar gin of marijuana,\nthat is, the logarithm of quantity, as function of these two v ariables as well as all regressors\nin equations 3using the subset of individuals that were oﬀered marijuana, t hat is, the set\nof individuals that presumably is exogenous to the access eq uation. Given that we still\nhave endogeneity due to the extensive margin in this set of in dividual, this is not a formal\ntest of exclusionary restrictions. However, the fact that p resence of drug dealer in the\nneighborhood, and consumption of alcohol and cigarettes ar e not statistical signiﬁcant to\nexplaintheintensivemargin, suggeststhatthesevariable shavesomevalidityasexclusionary\nrestrictions.\nFinally, we have included marijuana price in the intensive m argin equation, but not in\nthe access and extensive margin equations. Although this is not necessary for identiﬁcation,\nwe consider that excluding price from these equations make s ense. First, the argument to\nexclude marijuana price from the access equation is that ind ividuals who do not have access\nare unlikely to know the price of the marijuana they would obt ain. Second, exclusion of\nmarijuana price from the extensive margin equation is due to marijuana being very cheap\nin Colombia (US ¢83), consequently, price is not a barrier to deﬁne the extens ive margin.\n4.2 Robustness checks\nWe perform several exercises to check the robustness of the p osterior estimates of our\nbaseline speciﬁcation. First, as the deﬁnition of access is very relevant in our analysis, we\ncheck our results with another deﬁnition of access. In parti cular, our baseline deﬁnition\nof access is equal to one if an individual responds that is eas y to get marijuana, and zero\nin case that responds that it is diﬃcult, impossible or does n ot know how to get it. This\nimplies that 58% of our sample has access to marijuana. In thi s exercise, we relax the\naccess deﬁnition by including within the individuals who ha ve access those who report that\nit would be easy or diﬃcult to get marijuana. This new deﬁniti on of access implies that\n67% of individuals in the sample have access (see Table 11in the Appendix). We reran our\nbaseline model using this new deﬁnition of the accessibilit y, the results can be seen in the\nsecond column of tables 5,6and7, where we show the posteriors estimates for the access,\nextensive and intensive equations, respectively. In gener al, we obtain qualitatively similar\nresults in the alternative scenario relaxing the access deﬁ nition (column 2) compared to\nthe baseline estimates (column 1) in the three stages. In mos t of the posterior estimates\nthere are not statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in both ex ercises, except that individuals\nin high strata do not have statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerenc es compared with individuals in\nlow strata regarding access in this new set of estimates (see Table5).\nWe also estimate our baseline model usingthe subsetof uni-p ersonal households. Thisis\nbecause lying is a valid concern when modeling demand for ill icit drugs due to, for instance,\nsocial stigma ( Lloyd,2013). We guess that individuals who live alone have less incenti ves\nto lie regarding marijuana use. Column (3) in tables 5,6and7show the results using\nthis sub-sample. We observe again that there are not statist ically signiﬁcant diﬀerences\ncompared to the baseline exercise in the access and extensiv e margin, except that now\nthere are not statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences regardin g strata or being a worker. In\naddition, years of education is not statistically relevant in the extensive margin. However,\nwe observe some intriguing results in the intensive margin e stimates. In particular, three\nvery robust regressors in all the estimations are not statis tically signiﬁcant in this subset:\nfemale, marijuana users in the network and price. Although t heir coeﬃcients have the\nexpected sign. We suspect that can be a power issue due to bein g just 233 marijuana\nconsumers in this sub-sample.\nWe also include interaction eﬀects between age splines and ri sk perception about marijuana consumption in our main speciﬁcation. We perform this to identify potential heterogeneous eﬀects in this variable among age groups, thus thinki ngabout marketing campaigns\ntargeting young adults to curve marijuana consumption thro ugh risk perception. We observe in column (4) of Table 7that these variables are not statistically signiﬁcant, and in\ngeneral, we get very similar results in this alternative spe ciﬁcation compared to the baseline\nexercise.\nWegetourpricemeasureinthebaselineestimation calculat ingexpenditureinmarijuana\nover quantity. The advantage of this measure is that takes im plicitly quality into account\nwhen an individual buys diﬀerent types of marijuana. However , the survey asks directly\nindividuals about price, there is the question “Do you know h ow much amarijuana cigarette\nor joint costs? We estimate our model using this alternative measure of price, which implies\ncalculating again the quantity weighted by THC. Column (5) i n tables 5,6and7show the\nresults. It seems that our results are robust to the price mea sure, the price elasticity is\nnumerically lower under the alternative price compared to t he baseline exercise, but there\nis not statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences.\nA potential endogeneity issue that we did not take into accou nt in our main speciﬁcation is self-perception about health status. This variab le may be considered endogenous\n(Jacobi and Sovinsky ,2016), thus we estimate the baseline speciﬁcation without the me ntal\nand physical self-perception of health status. The results can be seen in column (6) of tables\n5,6and7. The results are very similar comparing this exercise with t he baseline speciﬁcation, except that medium strata do not have statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences with the\nlow strata in the extensive margin in this new setting.\nIn general, it seems that the results of the baseline speciﬁc ation are robust, there are\nnot statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in most of the cases compared to the alternative\nmeasures of relevant variables or model speciﬁcations. We o bserve that the same variables\nare statistically signiﬁcant in all three stages of demand f or marijuana, and the numeric\nvalues of the posterior estimates are relatively similar. H owever, the sub-sample of unipersonal households present some intriguing results, pote ntially due to power issues.\n5 Policy analysis\n5.1 Marijuana legalization\nWe perform some counterfactual experiments to estimate the potential eﬀects of the legalization of marijuana in Colombia for diﬀerent representativ e individuals. Particularly, we\nestimate the posterior predictive probability for individ ual 0,\np(A0,C0,Y0|T,X) =/integraldisplay\nS/integraldisplay\nΘ{1(A0= 0)1(Ua\n0≤0)+1(A0= 1)1(Ua\n0>0)\n×[1(C0= 0)1(Uc\n0≤0)+1(C0= 1)1(Cc\n0>0)]}\n×p(A0|T,X)×p(C0|A0,T,X)×p(Y0|C0,A0,T,X)π(θ,Σ|T,X)dθdΣ,\nwhereSis the support of integration of Σ,p(A0= 1|T,X) = 1−Φ(xa⊤\n0θa,1),p(C0=\n1|A0= 1,T,X) = 1−Φ(xc⊤\n0θc+σac(Ua\n0−xa⊤\n0θa),1−σ2\nac)andp(Y0|C0= 1,A0= 1,T,X)∼\nN(µy|ac,σ2\ny|ac), where\nµy|ac=xy⊤\n0θy+[σyaσyc]\n1σac\nσac1\n−1\nUa\n0−xa⊤\n0θa\nUc\n0−xc⊤\n0θc\n,\nσ2\ny|ac=σ2\ny−[σyaσyc]\n1σac\nσac1\n−1\nσya\nσyc\n.\nObserve the relevance of the selection parameters, σac,σyaandσycin the previous expressions. These account for unobserved dependence between the three stages of the demand\nfor marijuana.\nThe above integral can be estimated in a straight forward way using the draws from the\nposteriordistribution. Therefore, weusesimulation toes timatetheeﬀects ofthelegalization\nof marijuanaontheprobability of use, given that underlega lization theprobability of access\nis equal to 1, that is, p(A0= 1|T,X) = 1, and the amount of consumption, conditional on\nuse, where we take into account that we model log( Yit), so we get by simulation Yit, that\nis, the amount of joints per month.\nWe show in tables 8and9the results of these exercises for the representative individual who has access to marijuana. In particular, this is an individual with 12 years\nof education, working, good self-perception of health stat us, family members and friends\nwho do not consume marijuana, but she/he has consumed alcoho l and cigarettes, lives\nin Medell´ ın in a low socioeconomic stratum, and there is a dr ug dealer in the neighborhood. We have in these tables seven scenarios, rows one to thr ee in each panel show results\nunder diﬀerent scenarios about risk perceptions of marijuan a use, these experiments are\nbased on the fact that marketing campaigns warning about bad consequences of consuming\nsome products may curve demand. For instance, warning label ing explains why consumers\nbecome more health-conscious, and consequently, more risk -averse (Barahona et al. ,2023;\nBerg et al. ,2023;Cannoy et al. ,2023;Kaai et al. ,2023;Nguyen et al. ,2023;Nian et al. ,\n2023;Brennan et al. ,2022). Rows four to seven show results under diﬀerent price scenar ios,\nthe ones that we analyze in the next subsection for potential tax revenues, taxes contribute\nto raise revenues for public policy, and help to curve the dem and function ( Allcott et al. ,\n2019).\nWe can see in Table 8the results for the representative woman, where each panel\nshows results by age spline. For instance, the ﬁrst row in the ﬁrst panel shows the results\nunder a the baseline price for this representative woman (US ¢78.2), who has a high risk\nperception about marijuana use. We observe that the predict ed probability of having access\ntomarijuanais74.5%, andthepredictedprobabilitiesofma rijuanauseare1.30% and1.75%,\noverall women with these features, and those with access, re spectively. This means that\nthe probability of use overall these representative women i ncreases 0.44 percentage points\ngiven a policy of legalization of marijuana. Conditional on access and use, the predicted\nconsumption for this representative woman is 5.9 joints per month. All these estimates has\nthe standard errors that are calculated by simulation using repeated sampling.\nWe observe from Table 8that under legalization of marijuana, risk perception has a\nhigher eﬀect among women in decreasing the probability of use than price. For instance,\nthe second and third rows show that given access, the probabi lity of use increases 9.37\nand 4.58 percentage points for women who have a medium and low risk perceptions about\nmarijuana use, compared with just 0.44 p.p. for women with hi gh risk perception. However,\nthe eﬀect of risk perception decreases with age. We observe th e same pattern among men\n(see Table 9). Overall, taking into account thesethreerisk scenarios, age splines andgender,\nand using the expansion factors of the survey, we ﬁnd that the probability of use increases\nfrom 2.3% pre-legalization to 3.0% under legalization.\nGiven the eﬀect of risk perception, and the patterns of this by age splines, we can\ndeduce that marketing campaigns targeting young individua ls will be an eﬀective way to\ncurve demand for marijuana under a legal setting. First, you ng have a lower risk perception\nabout marijuana use than other age splines, the sample avera ge for a high risk is 88% for\nthe former, whereas this percentage is equal to 92%, 93% and 9 4% for 30s, 40s and 50s\nage splines, this means that there is a higher gap among young individuals. And second,\nreducing more the demand of this group implies that the cumul ative eﬀect on consumption\nthrough their life span is higher, with potentially more goo d externalities. However, we\nshould take into account that the eﬀect of risk perception has a limit, this is, on average\n91% of the individuals already have a high risk perception ab out marijuana use. This fact\nmotivates to perform experiments with diﬀerent prices (taxe s), which also means diﬀerent\nscenarios regarding government revenues.\nThus, the second set of experiments consider the eﬀect of lega lization of marijuana\non price, and as a consequence, on access, extensive and inte nsive margins. Particularly,\nmarijuana legalization implies that the inherent extra cos t dueto illegality would disappear.\nHowever, we should take a potential tax into account. A ﬁrst b enchmark is the average cost\nof marijuana in Colombia, V´ elez-Torres et al. (2021) found that the average production cost\nisUS¢1pergram, andtakingintoaccount thattheaverage percenta ge ofdistributioncost in\nColombia is 15%, the cost of one joint of marijuana is approxi mately US ¢1.15. In addition,\nthe average return of capital in Colombia is around 15.25% ac cording to Corﬁcolombiana,\na prestigious ﬁnancial institution in this country, ﬂuctua ting between 13.9% y 16.6%,3thus\na gram of marijuana has a base price without taxes of approxim ately US ¢1.33. The ﬁrst\ncounterfactual exercise usesas referencethetax oncigare ttes, whichisUS ¢5.9 inColombia,4\nthen the potential price of one gram of marijuana, tax includ ed, is approximately US ¢7.3.\nThis price can be considered as a potential lower bound due to being less expensive that\nthe legal price of cigarettes in Colombia, which is on averag e US¢11.5. Although, this price\nis higher than the price of illegal cigarettes, US ¢5.3.5The second exercise assumes that the\nprice of marijuana is equal to the legal price of cigarettes ( US¢11.5). Finally, the potential\nlower bound and the actual price of marijuana oﬀer a spectrum o f possibilities for tax\nscenarios. Thus, we perform two more experiments, 50% decre ase and 25% increase with\nrespect to the actual price of marijuana. The former implies a tax of US ¢37.8 per joint,\nwhich ismorethan6times thetax on cigarettes. Thelatter is basedon Jacobi and Sovinsky\n3SeeRentabilidad esperada del capital propio.\n4Realprice2019,see CERTIFICACI ´ON 4, 2021 of Direcci´ on General de Apoyo Fiscal del Ministerio de Ha cienda.\n5Real price 2019, see Estudio de incidencia del consumo de cigarrillos en colombia 2022.\nColombian case, this tax would be more than 16 times the tax of cigarettes. We think\nabout the this scenario as a potential upper bound price in th e case of legalization of\nmarijuana due to a relatively high price may imply a huge blac k market of marijuana in\nthis country. For instance, the size of the black market of ci garettes in Colombia is 34%.6\nThe fourth to seventh rows in each panel of tables 8and9show the results. We\nobserve that there are not remarkable diﬀerences regarding t he probability of access and\nuse under diﬀerent price settings; however, the intensity of consumption decreases with\nprice, as expected. The shape of the intensity margin as a fun ction of age splines has an\n“inverted U-shape”, that is, this is low for 20s and 50s, incr eases in 30s, and has a peak in\n40s. This latter group has a very high level of consumption, h owever, we should take with\ncaution this result due to the also high volatility level. Ob serve that price helps to curve\nthe intensity of consumption under a legalization policy; h owever, there are not signiﬁcant\nchanges in the extensive margin due to diﬀerent price regimes .\nOther patterns that we observe from tables 8and9are that access is lower for individuals who have a low risk perception regarding marijuana u se; however, the probability\nof marijuana use is higher for this group. In addition, acces s also decreases with age, and\nis higher for men, who in turn have a higher probability of use , and given use, have a\nsubstantially higher level of consumption, approximately two times the level of women.\nWe perform ceteris paribus exercises in order to isolate the eﬀects of diﬀerent control\nvariables, and get a better understanding of the situation. However, Manthey et al. (2023)\ndemonstrated that warning information about product use th at potentially curve consumption must be complemented with taxes (pricing). Both approa ches should be integrated as\npart of a comprehensive strategy aimed at mitigating the bur dens on public health, social\nwell-being, and economy, of marijuana use.\n6SeeEstudio de incidencia del consumo de cigarrillos en colombia 2022.\n5.2 Tax revenues\nWe perform some simulation exercises regarding the potenti al tax revenue that the government could collect from a tax on marijuana consumption under legalization. In particular,\nwe use the posterior draws to simulate the model for all the in dividuals in the survey using\nthe predictive framework of the previous subsection, assum ing that the probability of access is equal to one for every one under a legal framework. We e stimate the probability of\nconsumption given access for each individual, and use it to s ample from a Bernoulli distribution, if the realization of this experiment is 0, then the a ssociated consumption is 0, if the\nrealization is equal to 1, then, we predict their consumptio n conditional on access and use.\nThen, we use the expansion factors of the survey to estimate t he potential yearly tax revenues. The survey represents 23.6 million individuals betw een 12 and 65 years-old in 2019,\nthis is approximately 75% of the total Colombian population in this age range. Thus, we\nshould consider these predictions as underestimating the p otential revenue. Although, the\nmissing 25% of the population is located in relatively isola ted rural areas where potentially\nwould have not legal marijuana suppliers. We also take into a ccount that approximately\n34% of the demand of marijuana under a legal framework would b e in the black market.\nThis ﬁgure is based on the situation in the cigarettes market .7\nWe set fourth potential scenarios where all of them assume th at the diﬀerence between\nthe average cost per gram (US ¢1.33) and the price is equal to the tax. The ﬁrst is a\nlower bound where the price is equal to the cost (US ¢1.33) plus a tax that is equal to\nthe cigarette tax (US ¢5.9). The second scenario assumes that the price of marijuan a is\nequal to the average price of a legal cigarette, the third ass umes a price that is the 50%\nof approximately the actual average price that a representa tive individual with access pays\nfor a joint, and the fourth scenario uses a price that is 25% mo re expensive than the latter.\n7SeeEstudio de incidencia del consumo de cigarrillos en colombia 2022.\nWe can see in Table 10the results. We observe that the annually average tax revenu e\nunder legalization of marijuana in Colombia would be betwee n USD 11.0 million and USD\n54.2 million, depending on which taxation scheme is used. Th is is between 2.9% to 14.4%\nof the tax revenues of cigarettes, according to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit,\nthat reports tax revenues of cigarettes are equal to USD 374 m illion in 2019.8We should\ntake into account that in Colombia, the amount of cigarettes per month of a smoker is\n208, whereas the predicted average consumption of marijuan a under the counterfactual of\ncigarette priceis 57 permonth, almost four times less. Inad dition, thepredicted probability\nof useof marijuanais 2.5% inthis pricesetting underlegali zation, whereastheprobability of\ncigarette is 9.5% (reporting smoking in the last month), acc ording to the ENCSPA survey,\nthat is, approximately 4 times higher.\n6 Concluding remarks\nWe present an endogenous three-part model to estimate the de mandof marijuanain Colombia that allows to infer the potential eﬀects of its legalizat ion ﬁnding heterogeneous eﬀects\namongagegroupsandgender. Thus,weextend Jacobi and Sovinsky (2016)’sproposalmodeling simultaneously the three stages of marijuana demand ( access, extensive and intensive\nmargins), taking truncation into account.\nThemainestimationﬁndingsindicatethatwomenhavealower probabilityofaccess, use,\nand quantity of consumption than men. Individuals over 30 al so have a lower probability of\naccess and use than younger individuals (20s and below), and individuals with good mental\nhealth also have a lower probability of access and use. Overa ll, we ﬁnd that the demand\nfor marijuana exhibits inelasticity (-0.45); moreover, th ere is no statistically signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerence in this elasticity in prices across age groups. The se results are robust to diﬀerent\n8SeeMinisterio de hacienda y cr´ edito p´ ublico\nspeciﬁcations, and access, price and intensive margin deﬁn itions.\nWe also ﬁnd that a legalization policy would increase the pro bability of use from 2.3%\nto 3.0%, particularly aﬀecting young individuals, from 4.3% to 5.5%, where risk perception\nis a relevant driver to curve marijuana demand. Therefore, u nder a legalization policy, marketing warning the potential bad consequences of consuming marijuana targeting younger\nindividuals would be mandatory. Therefore, part of the pote ntial tax revenues, which under a realistic setting would be approximately USD 32 millio n, should be invested in these\nwarning campaigns. In addition, we have that given the relat ively low price of marijuana\nin Colombia, this variable can be use to drive the intensive m argin, rather than the extensive margin. In any case, warning campaigns should be com plemented with taxes as a\ncomprehensive strategy to mitigate negative eﬀects associa ted with marijuanaconsumption.\nWe consider in this study the short-term eﬀects of a legalizat ion policy on the extensive\nand intensive margins of marijuana demand, and potential ta x revenues from this activity.\nHowever, future research should consider long-term eﬀects o f this policy. In this point, the\n“gateway hypothesis”isrelevant asalegal frameworkforma rijuanaconsumptionmay imply\nconsequences on consumption of more toxic drugs due to the po lydrug use. In addition,\nother aspects of a policy of legalization should be consider ed, for instance, eﬀects on public\nhealth, labor and crime. The latter is particularly relevan t in Colombia due to the relevance\nof marijuana in the micro traﬃc business.\nTable 1: Summary Statistics.\nVariable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nAccess to marijuana0.58 0.00 1.00 0.57 1.00\n(0.49) (0.00) (0.00) (0.5) (0.00)\nMarijuana consumer0.02 0.00 0.04 0.00 1.00\n(0.15) (0.00) (0.20) (0.00) (0.00)\nQuantity consumed1.01 0.00 1.75 0.00 43.08\n(13.61) (0.00) (17.89) (0.00) (78.07)\nDrug dealer in neighborhood0.38 0.26 0.47 0.38 0.50\n(0.49) (0.44) (0.50) (0.48) (0.50)\nAlcohol and tobacco user0.32 0.22 0.40 0.31 0.86\n(0.47) (0.41) (0.49) (0.46) (0.35)\nPrice of marijuana0.83 0.86 0.80 0.83 0.84\n(0.44) (0.48) (0.40) (0.43) (0.54)\nFemale0.58 0.67 0.52 0.59 0.25\n(0.49) (0.47) (0.50) (0.49) (0.44)\nYears of education11.8 11.48 12.04 11.79 12.34\n(4.24) (4.46) (4.04) (4.25) (3.75)\nWorker0.58 0.53 0.61 0.58 0.59\n(0.49) (0.5) (0.49) (0.49) (0.49)\nGood mental health0.79 0.81 0.77 0.79 0.70\n(0.41) (0.39) (0.42) (0.41) (0.46)\nGood physical health0.77 0.75 0.77 0.76 0.79\n(0.42) (0.43) (0.42) (0.42) (0.41)\nMarijuana users in network 0.36 0.19 0.49 0.35 0.94\n(0.48) (0.39) (0.50) (0.48) (0.24)\nAge 20’s or younger 0.34 0.30 0.38 0.34 0.67\n(0.47) (0.46) (0.48) (0.47) (0.47)\nAge 30’s 0.21 0.19 0.23 0.21 0.20\n(0.41) (0.4) (0.42) (0.41) (0.40)\nAge 40’s 0.17 0.17 0.16 0.17 0.08\n(0.37) (0.38) (0.37) (0.38) (0.27)\nAge 50’s or older 0.28 0.34 0.23 0.28 0.05\n(0.45) (0.47) (0.42) (0.45) (0.23)\nRisk perception of usage:\nLow 0.04 0.05 0.03 0.03 0.09\n(0.19) (0.21) (0.16) (0.18) (0.29)\nMedium 0.05 0.03 0.07 0.05 0.30\n(0.22) (0.17) (0.25) (0.21) (0.46)\nHigh 0.91 0.92 0.90 0.92 0.61\n(0.28) (0.26) (0.30) (0.27) (0.49)\nSocio-economic Strata:\nLow 0.64 0.65 0.64 0.65 0.56\n(0.48) (0.48) (0.48) (0.48) (0.5)\nMedium 0.32 0.31 0.32 0.32 0.38\n(0.47) (0.46) (0.47) (0.47) (0.49)\nHigh 0.08 0.08 0.08 0.08 0.13\n(0.28) (0.28) (0.28) (0.28) (0.33)\nSample size 49,414 20,909 28,505 48,255 1,159\nNotes: Standard deviations in parenthesis.

Technical rep ort, National Bureau of\nEconomic Research.\nA.1 Quantity consumed weighted by marijuana type\nThere are diﬀerent types of marijuana, among which the ENCSPA highlights regular, corinto, creepy, and others. All of these have diﬀerent intensit ies of active compounds ( tetrahydrocannabinol - THC). It is crucial to weigh the amounts consumed by the prop ortion of\nactive compounds, thus converting the diﬀerent varieties in to one in common. Taking into\naccount the studies of Casta˜ no-P´ erez et al. (2017) andPach´ on(2012), we learn that the\ncorinto and regular varieties cannot be considered statist ically diﬀerent in terms of their\nTHC composition (therefore, for this study, they will be con sidered as the same variety);\nWhile the creepy variety can contain on average up to 4 times m ore THC than the regular\none. With this in mind, the nearest neighbor algorithm is est imated to ﬁnd the price of\neach variety for all individuals consuming marijuana. Taki ng advantage of the fact that\nthere are individuals who only consume one class, a Euclidea n distance is calculated from\nobservable characteristics between individuals who consu me more than one variety and individuals who only consume a single one, and the nearest neig hbor price is associated.\nOnce we have the price for each marijuana type consumed by all marijuana consumers, we\nassume that the price reported in the survey corresponds to a weighted average of the consumption of each class; therefore, using the following equa tions, we can obtain the amounts\nper variety for creepy and regular:\nAvg. price =pricei×quantityi+pricej×quantityj\nTotal consumption = quantityi+quantityj\nFinally, after having the amounts per variety, the quantiti es of creepy are multiplied\nby 4 (since this is the proportion of more THC among the strain s), leaving everything in\nterms of regular marijuana. As for users of the “other” class (0.3% of the total population\nand 7% of marijuana users), it is not possible to know precise ly the intensity of the active\ncompound. Therefore, including them in the analysis is not p ossible, and they are not taken\ninto account in this analysis.\nA.2 Prices\nWe can ﬁnd a direct measure of price by dividing the monthly ex penditure by the average\nnumber of units consumed by individuals who report marijuan a consumption in the last\nyear. However, the price is not directly observed for indivi duals who report no consumption\nof marijuana. Thus, we follow the nearest neighbor algorith m to impute price: First, prices\nbelow 10% and above 95% of the speciﬁc drugprice distributio n are left out of consideration\nas we want to avoid a bias toward the imputed distribution due to extreme values. Second,\nweimputethepriceofmarijuanaforthoseindividualswhore portnomarijuanaconsumption\nusing the average price for the same municipality and stratu m. Third, if there is not a\nmarijuana consumer in the same municipality and stratum, we use the average price at the\nmunicipality level, then, theaverage priceat thestratuml evel, andﬁnally, theunconditional\naverage price, in case there is not any match.\nA.3 Risks perceptions\nWe created a single measure of risk perception from the quest ions asked in the survey\nabout self-perceived risk according to the use of marijuana at diﬀerent frequencies (rarely,\nsometimes, and frequently). Each of these three variables t akes the ordered values of 1 if\nyou consider it to be no risk, 2 slight risks, 3 moderate risks , and 4 high risks. To create a\nsinglemeasurewetake theaverage between thethreevariabl es anddivideit intothreebroad\ncategories of low risk, medium risk, and ﬁnally high risk (in dependently of the frequency).\nA.4 Diﬀerent access, prices, and quantities measures\nWe use diﬀerent measures of access, prices, and quantities co nsumed of marijuana weighted\nby THC content to test the robustness of the estimates to smal l changes in the deﬁnitions of\neach variable from the survey data. In particular, we made va riations in three key variables.\nThe changes made are as follows.\nTable11shows the descriptive statistics of these three alternativ e measures compared to\ndescriptive statistics in Table 1. We observe that the new deﬁnition of access implies overall\nmore individualshaving access to marijuanaas expected. Th isincreases 9 percentage points\ncompared to the baseline setting. Note that columns 2 and 3 in Table11correspond to the\ndata ﬁltered by the access variable under the main deﬁnition used in the primary analysis.\nThe access variable under the deﬁnition used for heterogene ous eﬀects is less strict. It\ndiﬀers from the original deﬁnition so that 22% more of the peop le with access originally\nend up having access under this deﬁnition (Table 11, Column 2, Row 4). Regarding prices\nand quantities, we observe that the baseline and alternativ e settings are very similar. This\nmeans that these measures are both relatively consistent.\nTable 11: Summary statistics diﬀerent measures of access, prices , and quantities.\nAll Access (main) to marijuana Marijuana consumer\nVariable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nMain 0.58 0.00 1.00 0.57 1.00\n(0.49) (0.00) (0.00) (0.5) (0.00)\nRobustness 0.67 0.22 1.00 0.66 1.00\n(0.47) (0.41) (0.00) (0.47) (0.00)\nMain 1.01 0.00 1.75 0.00 43.08\n(13.61) (0.00) (17.89) (0.00) (78.07)\nRobustness 1.05 0.00 1.82 0.00 44.67\n(14.04) (0.00) (18.44) (0.00) (80.36)\nMain 0.83 0.86 0.80 0.83 0.84\n(0.44) (0.48) (0.40) (0.43) (0.54)\nRobustness 0.81 0.84 0.79 0.81 0.84\n(0.3) (0.31) (0.28) (0.29) (0.37)\nSample size 49,414 20,909 28,505 48,255 1,159\nNotes: Standard deviations in parenthesis.

In the standard Bell scenario, when making a local projectiv e\nmeasurement on each system component, the amount of randomn ess generated is\nrestricted. However, this limitation can be surpassed thro ugh the implementation\nof sequential measurements. Nonetheless, a rigorous deﬁni tion of random numbers\nin the context of sequential measurements is yet to be establ ished, except for the\nlower quantiﬁcation in device-independent scenarios. In t his paper, we deﬁne quantum\nintrinsic randomness in sequential measurements and quant ify the randomness in\nthe Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequa lity sequential scenario.\nInitially, we investigate the quantum intrinsic randomnes s of the mixed states under\nsequential projective measurements and the intrinsic rand omness of the sequential\npositive-operator-valued measure (POVM) under pure state s. Naturally, we rigorously\ndeﬁne quantum intrinsic randomness under sequential POVM f or arbitrary quantum\nstates. Furthermore, we apply our method to one-Alice and tw o-Bobs sequential\nmeasurement scenarios, and quantify the quantum intrinsic randomness of the\nmaximally entangled state and maximally violated state by g iving an extremal\ndecomposition. Finally, using the sequential Navascues-Pironio-Acin (NPA) hierarchy\nin the device-independent scenario, we derive lower bounds on the quantum intrinsic\nrandomness of the maximally entangled state and maximally v iolated state.\n1. Introduction\nRandom numbers are essential in information technology, es pecially information\nsecurity [ 1]. Many cryptographic protocols [ 2,3] require random numbers to prevent\nattackers from predicting the outcomes of security-relate d computations to ensure data\nsecurity.\n‡wykun06@gmail.com\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 2\nIn general, there are three main types of random number gener ators, pseudo-random\nnumber generators, classic physical random number generat ors, and quantum random\nnumber generators. However, pseudo-random number generat ors and classic physical\nrandom number generators do not generate truly random numbe rs, as their randomness\ncannot be theoretically proven [ 4]. Quantum random number generators (QRNG) [ 5-9]\nis a device that generates random numbers according to the un certainty principle of\nquantum mechanics, ensuring that the generated numbers are truly random.\nIn practice, quantum devices encounter challenges such as n oise and potential\nthird-party interference, necessitating the authenticat ion of the generated random\nnumbers. Therefore, device-independent protocols [ 6,10-12] for random number\ngeneration have been proposed. These generators have valid ation properties that\nallow them to go through cleverly designed tests, such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\n(CHSH) non-locality, to verify that the generated random numbers a re truly random and\nunpredictable and rule out any possible potential attacks o r vulnerabilities. Therefore,\ndevice-independent quantum true random number generators exhibit higher reliability\nin terms of security and trustworthiness. However, the test s that device-independent\nprotocols are based on usually result in a relatively low gen eration rate of veriﬁable\nrandom numbers. To enhance the generation rate of veriﬁable random numbers,\nresearchers have conducted extensive studies and investig ations. Nonprojective\nmeasurements, more speciﬁcally positive-operator-value d measures (POVMs) can\ngenerate more randomness by having more outcome possibilit ies than the dimension\nof the quantum system they operate on. In [ 13,14], the authors proposed a selftesting method based on the nonprojective POVMs, which enab les the generation of the\noptimal possible random numbers consistent with the system ’s dimensionality. In [ 15],\nthe authors assert that by performing nonprojective measur ements sequentially, namely\nweak measurements [ 16-18], on an arbitrarily weakly entangled system, nonlocality\ncan be shared between the sequential pairs of observers. In p rinciple, this sharing of\nnonlocality between sequential pairs can yield an inﬁnite a mount of randomness.\nSubsequently, non-locality sharing in sequential measure ments under diﬀerent\nentanglement resources and non-locality inequalities hav e been studied [ 19-26], and\ntheoretically, they all can achieve unlimited random numbe r generation. The\nmeasurements in sequential scenarios usually involve POVM s. However, unlike\nprojective measurements, there are additional and possibl y hidden degrees of freedom\nin the apparatus for POVM. How to quantify the intrinsic rand omness of the outcomes\nfrom POVM is an important and hard problem, given a set of POVM elements may\nhave an inﬁnite number of ways to construct the detection ins trument [ 27,28]. This\nhidden information makes it very challenging to characteri ze the amount of information\nleaked to Eve. [ 29,30] addressed this problem in non-sequential scenarios. In [ 29], the\nintrinsic randomness for general states under POVM is chara cterized by minimizing all\npossible extensions by Naimark extension [ 31]. And in [ 30], the intrinsic randomness\nis quantiﬁed by introducing an eavesdropper Eve. The quantu m intrinsic randomness\nunder POVM is then obtained according to diﬀerent degrees of correlation between\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 3\nEve and quantum systems. However, a rigorous deﬁnition of ra ndom numbers in the\ncontext of sequential measurements is yet to be established , except for the guessing\nproblem quantiﬁcation in device-independent scenario [ 32]. It is also highly meaningful\nto know how much randomness is in sequential POVMs, particul arly in cases where the\nmeasurement operations are known but the speciﬁc implement ation details are unknown.\nIn sequential scenarios, the detection instrument decompo sition of the POVMs\nmay give rise to potential correlations between the sequent ial measurements, thus the\ninter-round correlations should be eliminated when charac terizing the randomness in\nthe sequential measurements. In this paper, we provide a rig orous deﬁnition and\nquantiﬁcation of veriﬁable random numbers generated under diﬀerent levels of device\ntrustworthiness, encompassing both trusted and untrusted sources (prepared states and\nthe operated measurements). The organization of the paper i s as follows. In section 2,\nwe provide two theorems that deﬁne the intrinsic randomness of quantum measurement\nunder sequential projective measurement with a shared arbi trary state and sequential\nPOVM with a shared pure state, respectively. Based on the abo ve theorems, we obtain\nthe deﬁnition of intrinsic randomness under the sequential POVM with the shared\narbitrary state. In section 3, we apply our method to the Alice, two Bobs sequential\nscenario and quantify the quantum intrinsic randomness for the maximally entangled\nstate and maximally violated state under CGLMP inequalities. Initially, we examine\nthe quantum intrinsic randomness in the source-trusted cas e. Subsequently, we obtain\nbounds on the quantum intrinsic randomness using the sequen tial NPA method in the\ndevice-independent scenario.\n2. Intrinsic randomness in sequential measurements\n2.1. Preparation with noise\nTo provide a comprehensive introduction to our work, it is es sential to review the\nconcept of sequential measurement. The considered nonloca lity sharing scenario is with\nentangled qubits, where a single observer, namely Alice, ha s access to one of the particles\nof the entangled pair, and a group of observers, Bobi(i∈ {1,...,n}), has access to the\nsecond particle. Each Bobiacts independently, performing a local measurement on the\nparticle before passing it on to the next member of the group, see ﬁgure 1.\nWe denote the inputs of Alice and Bobias X and Yi, respectively, and their outputs\nas A and Bi.\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 4\nFigure 1. Sequential measurement scenario.\nBob’s acting independent restriction in the requirement is that each Bob in the\nsequence can only send a single qubit (his post-measurement state) to the next. In\nparticular, the classical information about measurement c hoices and outcomes of each\nBob is not shared.\nQuantum randomness, namely intrinsic randomness, refers t o randomness that\nexcludes all possible classical randomness in observed out comes. To accurately\nquantify this intrinsic randomness, it is necessary to cons ider potential noise that\nmay be present in the whole system, including both the state a nd measurement\nprocesses. Minimum entropy is commonly utilized to charact erize the randomness of a\nprobability distribution, corresponding to the most conse rvative way of measuring the\nunpredictability of a set of outcomes.\nTo eliminate the inﬂuence of known information such as the ch oice of measurement\noperation and noise, quantum intrinsic randomness can be ch aracterized using\nconditional minimum entropy. Taking into consideration th e potential manipulation or\nprediction of classical and quantum side information by adv ersaries, this paper explores\nthe classical and quantum correlations between eavesdropp er Eve and the system to\nguessregarding measurement outcomes. Then the randomness in out comes\nis deﬁned by the conditional minimum entropy\nH∞(a/vectorb|A/vectorBE) =−log2[pguess]. (1)\nIn our study, we focus on the sequential measurement model gi ven in ﬁgure 1, which\nhas been widely proposed and studied in non-local sharing be tween sequential parties.\nNote that, it is easily extendable to a simple scenario where quantum states are prepared\nand only sent to one side multiple Bobs for measurement to obt ain randomness, without\ninvolving Alice. For instance, in the simplest model, a |0/an}bracketri}htstate is prepared, and multiple\nBob sequentially performs measurements using the XandZbases. In principle, when\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 5\nthe devices are trusted (i.e., they indeed prepare the claim ed states and perform the\nspeciﬁed measurements) and the sequential parties are inﬁn ite, an unbounded amount\nof randomness can be generated. However, in practice, one mu st also consider the\nremoval of noise in measurements and quantum states to chara cterize true quantum\nrandomness. Furthermore, if assuming that the devices come from an untrusted third\nparty, then Eve can disturb the devices signiﬁcantly. There fore, it becomes necessary\nto consider device-independent scenarios, where sequenti al non-locality sharing needs\nto be observed as a measure of quantumness to ensure and quant ify randomness. To\nachieve non-locality sharing in this scenario, each Bob nee ds to act independently. Our\ndeﬁnition of randomness is not limited to Bob’s independenc e, which can be extended to\nscenarios where classical signals are allowed, such as the t ransmission of measurement\nbasis choices.\nWe initially examine the ideal case of the measurements, nam ely the measurements\nwithout noise case, to quantify the quantum intrinsic rando mness in the outcomes of the\nsequential measurements. In this case, only the prepared st ates may have noise, thus we\nconsider the initial state to be mixed. Alice and Bob1sharing a mixed state, with each\nBob choosing to perform a projective measurement, represen ts the ideal scenario that\nwe consider. When representing the state of an entanglement systemSwith a mixed\nstateρsthat is compatible with an ensemble {p(λ),|φλ/an}bracketri}ht}. Eve may generate classical\ncorrelations with quantum systems through random variable sΛ ={λ}. Speciﬁcally, Eve\ncan sample a large number of values of the random variable Λand use this information\nto predict the outcome of the measurement on the system bette r than the honest user\nAlice. Given that a mixed state may consist of many ensembles of pure states, we must\nconsider all possible forms of these ensembles to character ize the quantum intrinsic\nrandomness present in them. This rationale leads to the deﬁn ition of Eve’s classical\nguessing probability as,\npC\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E) = max\np(λ),|φλ/an}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht/summationdisplay\nλp(λ)max\n/vectorb/an}bracketle{tφλ|Πb1\ny1...Πbn\nynΠbn−1\nyn−1...Πb1\ny1|φλ/an}bracketri}ht,(2)\nwhich maximizes all the pure ensembles of the mixed state, th us characterizing Eve’s\nmaximum guessing ability. A larger pC\nguessindicates a stronger guessing ability for Eve,\nimplying her capacity to obtain the randomness of measureme nt outcomes. The intrinsic\nrandomness in the outcomes of the sequential measurements t hen is quantiﬁed by the\nconditional minimum entropy of Eve’s guessing probability . For Eve’s classical guessing\nprobability, it is\nH∞(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E) =−log2[pC\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E)], (3)\nbounding the amount of randomness generated in the worst sce nario.\nMoreover, through the establishment of quantum correlatio ns with the prepared\nsystem by purifying the prepared state to |ψSE/an}bracketri}ht, Eve could have the potential to acquire\nquantum side information. By this correlation with the Main system, Eve could have\nthe state {ρ/vectorb\n/vector y}E=TrS[(Π/vectorb\n/vector y⊗IE)|ψSE/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tψSE|]/p(/vectorb,/vector y)after the measurement of Π/vectorb\n/vector yon\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 6\nMain system. Usually, the state {ρ/vectorb\n/vector y}Emay not be diagonal on the same basis, then Eve\ncould hold quantum side information more than classical var iableλ. This observation\nsuggests Eve possesses the capability to manipulate or extr act information about /vectorbfrom\nher side of the system. When the mixed state ρsis being measured, Eve can acquire\ninformation about the post-measurement state and subseque ntly choose measurement\noperator Π/vectorb\nEthat optimally predicts the measurement outcomes of the mix ed state. For\nthe sequential projective measurements {Πbiyi}i, the quantum guessing probability of Eve\ncan be mathematically expressed as follows:\npQ\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E) = max\n{Π/vectorb\nE}/vectorb/summationdisplay\n/vectorb/an}bracketle{tψSE|Πb1\ny1...Πbn\nynIS⊗Π/vectorb\nEΠbn\nyn...Πb1\ny1|ψSE/an}bracketri}ht,(4)\nwhere|ψSE/an}bracketri}htis any ﬁxed puriﬁcation of ρs. Eve optimizes over measurements Π/vectorb\nto maximize the guessing probability. Once Eve sent the prep ared state to the main\nsystemS, she could not access the main system anymore except to opera te the system\non her site.\nWith the two deﬁnitions of the guessing probability of Eve in both classical and\nquantum correlations, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. For every state and sequential projective measurement\npQ\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E) =pC\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E).\nH∞(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E) =−log2[pC\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E)] =−log2[pQ\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,ρs,{Πbi\nyi}i,E)].\nThe proof is given in the appendix. It implies that, under the sequence of projective\nmeasurements, when considering only the correlations of Ev e on the prepared state, both\nher quantum-capable and classical-capable abilities resu lt in an equal probability of\nsuccessfully obtaining the measurement outcomes, and thus generate the same amount\nof randomness.\n2.2. Sequential measurements with noise\nIn this section, we examine the inﬂuence of sequential POVM o n characterizing\nrandom numbers. Before presenting our contributions, it is important to review how\nsequential POVM impacts the characterization of randomnes s. When give a quantum\nstate and a POVM set, it is necessary to eliminate classical r andomness from it. The\nPOVM, similar to a mixed state, possesses unitary degrees of freedom, resulting in\nvarious decompositions. To remove the classical randomnes s, all possible forms of\nPOVM decomposition must be taken into account. In the contex t of sequential POVM,\nthe analysis of randomness requires considering not only di ﬀerent forms of POVM\ndecomposition but also the intercorrelations between sequ ential measurements.\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 7\nConsider the most commonly concerned case, CHSH non-locali ty sharing. As\nillustrated in [ 26], the setup is one-sided sequential measurements where one of the\nparties has two independent observers. Alice and Bob1share the pure two-qubit\nstate|φ/an}bracketri}ht=1√\n2(|00/an}bracketri}ht+|11/an}bracketri}ht)and the considered measurements strategy for nonlocality sharing are as follows, {A0|0=I+cos(θ)σz+sin(θ)σx\n2,A0|1=I+cos(θ)σz−sin(θ)σx\n2.}and\n{B1\n0|0=I+σx\n2,B1\n0|1=I+ε0σz\n2;B2\n0|0=I+σx\n2,B2\n0|1=I+ε1σz\n2}. The subscript {b|y}ofB\nrepresents the outcomes and the measurement chosen by Bob, w hile the superscript of\nBrepresents the sequence number of Bob. We consider the scenario where there are\ntwo sequential on Bob’s side and focus on the measurements of B1\n0|1and B2\n0|1. The\nresulting post-measurement state is determined by the deco mposition of Bob1. After\nBob1has been measured, it passes the post-measurement state to B ob2. Then Bob2can\nindependently select one of the two measurements as deﬁned t o measure. To lower bound\nthe randomness, we should allow Eve to implement the POVMs ar bitrarily. Assume that\nEve characterizes the observed probability distribution t hrough convex decomposition,\nand has the following decomposition,\nPOVM{B1\ni|1}=εiP0+(1−εi)P1, (5)\nwhereP0={|0/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t0|,|1/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t1|}, andP1={|1/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t1|,|0/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t0|}, which have been proved to be\nstandard decomposition form for qubit system [ 33].\nDespite the independence and irrelevance of Bob’s actions, Eve may possess diﬀerent\nεi, which can aﬀect the subsequent choices based on the previou s round’s selection,\nrendering Bob unable to detect this correlation. For instan ce, whenε0=ε1, Eve\nselects the projective measurement P0for both Bob1and Bob2with a probability of ε0.\nConversely, with a probability of 1−ε0, Eve opts for the projective measurement P1for\nboth Bob1and Bob2. In this strategy, once Eve correctly guesses b1, she obtains the\nknowledge of the outcome of b2. Thus, the observed probabilities in this case, which\nare,\np(b1,b2|B1\n1,B2\n1) =ε0ε1/an}bracketle{tφ|Pb1\n0Pb2\n0Pb1\n0|φ/an}bracketri}ht.\n+ε0(1−ε1)/an}bracketle{tφ|Pb1\n0Pb2\n1Pb1\n0|φ/an}bracketri}ht.\n+(1−ε0)ε1/an}bracketle{tφ|Pb1\n1Pb2\n0Pb1\n1|φ/an}bracketri}ht.\n+(1−ε0)(1−ε1)/an}bracketle{tφ|Pb1\n1Pb2\n1Pb1\n1|φ/an}bracketri}ht,(6)\ncannot be directly used to deﬁne the randomness by their minentropy. The inﬂuence of\nthe classical variables of εneeds to be eliminated. In the following section, we will foc us\non addressing the methods to resolve this issue, and then we w ill know the randomness\nshould be quantiﬁed by the guessing probability of\npguess(b1,b2|B1\n1,B2\n1,E) =maxb1/an}bracketle{tφ|Pb1\n0|φ/an}bracketri}ht, (7)\nwhich is the correctly guessing probability of Eve about Bob ’s outcomes, given the\nmeasurements B1\n1,B2\n1, and the knowledge she possesses (represented by the variab le\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 8\nE). Before exploring the most general scenario, we examine s equential POVM applied\nto a pure-state system. To maximize the preservation of enta nglement in the postmeasurement state, we utilize unsharp measurement for the q uantum system. We\nexamine a scenario wherein sequential POVMs, represented b y POVM {Mbi\nS}bi, are\nperformed on the main system Sthat is initially in a pure state |ψS/an}bracketri}ht. Given that the\nset of POVMs is, like the set of quantum states, convex, we can proceed via analogy\nwith the case of a mixed state.

Quantum gue ssing probabilities were\ninitially introduced by Frauchig et al. in their work [ 34], wherein they examined\ngeneral POVMs (non-sequential scenarios) using the Naimar k extension. We extend\ntheir approach and apply it to the deﬁnition of quantum guess ing probabilities under\nsequential measurements. According to the Naimark extensi on, a general measurement\nof the main system can be regarded as a project measurement of the composite system\nconsisting of the main system and an auxiliary system A as sho wn in ﬁgure 2.{Πbiyi}bi\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 9\nwhich acts on joint system SAi, is a Naimark extension of Mbi\nS, and the correlations\nwith Eve are represented by a mixed state σAon the auxiliary system A, for which she\npossesses a puriﬁcation |φAiEi/an}bracketri}ht. The puriﬁcation process enables Eve to establish an\nentanglement relationship with both the system S and the anc illa A. This allows Eve\nto gain access to the quantum side information of the main sys tem. Eve then performs\noptimizations on measurements conducted on her subsystem. We could introduce one\nEve for each individual within the sequence, denoted as Mbi\nEi, to guess the outcomes of\nBobi’s outcomes. However, notice that we allow Eves to exhibit in teractions among\nthemselves. For such scenarios, instead of introducing ind ividual measurement, we\nintroduce a joint measurement M/vectorb\n/vectorEthat oﬀers 2npossible outcomes to characterize\nEve’s capacity. This may give Eve more information than indi vidual measurements.\nAiming to maximize the correlation with the measurement out comes of the user, the\nmaximal quantum guessing probability for Eve can be determi ned as follows:\npQ\nguess(/vectorb|/vector y,|ψS/an}bracketri}ht,{Mbi\nS}i,E) = max\n{Πbiyi}bi,|φAiEi/an}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht,{Mbi\nEi}bi/summationdisplay\n/vectorb(/productdisplay\ni/an}bracketle{tψS|/an}bracketle{tφAiEi|(Π/vectorb\n/vector y)†⊗Mbi\nEiΠ/vectorb\n/vector y|φAiEi/an}bracketri}ht|ψS/an}bracketri}ht,\nΠ/vectorb\n/vector y= Πbn\nyn...Πb1\ny1\ntrAi[Πbi\nSAi(IS⊗trEi[|φAiEi/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tφAiEi|])] =Mbi\nS,∀bi.\ntr(Πbi\nyi⊗I|Πbi−1\nyi−1,...,Πb1\ny1ψS/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tΠbi−1\nyi−1,...,Πb1\ny1ψS|) = tr(Mbi\nyiρpost\nS),\nwithρpost\ns=|φ/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tφ|post,where\n|φ/an}bracketri}htpost=/summationdisplay\nλi,...,λi−1/radicalBig\nMbn−1,λi−1yn−1,...,/radicalBig\nMb1,λ1y1|ψS/an}bracketri}ht,\nwhereΠ/vectorb\n/vector y= Πbnyn...Πb1y1represents the sequential projective measurements perfor med on\nthe received state.

This advantage often\nrelies on the entanglement between S and A, where Eve can gain an advantage by\nmeasuring her system, obtaining more information about the main system than the\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 11\nclassical side information scenario.

Application: The randomness in shared entanglement scen ario under\n3.1. CGLMP inequality\nBell’s inequality forms the basis for the study of quantum en tanglement, nonlocality, and the secure certiﬁcation of random numbers in t he device-independent\nscenario. To deepen our understanding of entanglement and n on-locality, various\ngeneralized Bell inequalities have been derived. The CGLMP inequality is an example\nspeciﬁcally designed for high-dimensional quantum system s. It takes the form:\nId=⌊d\n2−1⌋/summationdisplay\nk=0(1−2k\nd−1)[f(k)−f(−k−1)], (12)\nf(k) =P(A1=B1+k)+P(B1=A2+k+1)+P(A2=B2+k)+P(B2=A1+k),\nP(A1=B1+k) =d−1/summationdisplay\nj=0P(A1=j,B1= (j+k) modd), (14)\nwhereP(A1=B1+k)that the measurements A1andB1have outcomes that diﬀer,\nmodulod, byk.\nAlice and Bob are two observers, each equipped with the capab ility to perform two\nmeasurements, each yielding doutcomes. A 1and A 2represent the measurement settings\nof Alice, and B 1and B 2represent the measurement settings of Bob. In this paper,\nour primary focus lies on the CGLMP inequality in 3-dimensio nal quantum systems.\nSpeciﬁcally, the CGLMP inequality for qutrits, which corre spond to 3-dimensional\nquantum systems, can be derived from equation ( 12).\nI3=P(A1=B1)+P(B1=A2+1)\n+P(A2=B2)+P(B2=A1)\n−P(A1=B1−1)−P(B1=A2)\n−P(A2=B2−1)−P(B2=A1−1).(15)\nAn intriguing fact is that, for dimensions d≥3, the quantum state that results in\nthe maximum violation of the CGLMP inequality is not the maxi mally entangled state\n(MES). Rather, the optimal state is known as the maximum viol ation state (MVS). The\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 12\nform of the maximally entangled state in a three-dimensiona l quantum system is given\nby:\n|ψMES/an}bracketri}ht=1√\n3(|00/an}bracketri}ht+|11/an}bracketri}ht+|22/an}bracketri}ht).

Sharing qutrit non-locality in one-sided sequential m easurements\nThe violation of Bell’s inequality in quantum systems serve s as a witness for\nquantum non-locality. Quantum non-locality and entanglem ent are the foundation\nfor the generation of quantum randomness. The relation betw een randomness and\nnonlocality is an interesting issue. The researchers came u p with a non-local guessing\ngame to characterize the relationship. In this work, we inve stigate the violation of the\nCGLMP inequality by the maximum entangled state and the maxi mum violated state in\na 1-Alice and 2-Bobs sequence scenario. The measurement set tings at Alice are denoted\nby|k/an}bracketri}htA/an}bracketle{tk|Aand the weak measurements on the Bobmside is in the form:\nEl\nBmy=εm|l/an}bracketri}htB,y/an}bracketle{tl|B,y+1−εm\n3I3. (21)\nFor each participant Bobm, the two measurements have introduced the same noisy\nparameter εm. Alice and Bob1shared the maximally entangled state (as described\nin equation ( 16)). Then, Alice and Bob1performed local measurements for the CGLMP\ntest, as described in equations ( 18), (19), (20) and ( 21). The value of the violated\nCGLMP inequality is:\nI1\n3=4\n9(3+2√\n3)ε1.

Randomness in observed statistics\nIn this section, we investigate the generation of random num bers under the CGLMP\nsequential measurement scenario discussed above, within t he noise interval where both\nI1\n3andI2\n3violations. We will analyze both trustworthy states and mea surements, as\nwell as untrustworthy states and measurements.\n3.3.1. quantum randomness in trusted quantum system scenar ioThe trustworthiness\nof the states and measurements refers to the knowledge of the ir density operator and\nPOVM form, while their speciﬁc decomposition forms are unkn own. We consider the\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 14\nstate to be in a pure form. Based on our deﬁnition of randomnes s, when the state is pure,\nthe quantum guessing probability and classical guessing pr obability are equal. Therefore,\nto quantify the randomness, it is necessary to explore all po ssible decomposition forms of\nmeasurements. The average probability with which the veriﬁ er can guess the outcomes\nobserved by Alice and Bob correctly, given his knowledge of t he inputs is thus given by\nG(a,/vectorb|x,/vector y,λi) =/summationdisplay\niλimax\na,/vectorb,{Pb1y1}λitr(ρAB{Pb1\ny1}λi)tr({Pb1\ny1}λiρAB{Pb1\ny1}†\nλiMa\nx⊗Mb2\ny2).(26)\nAs mentioned, Mb2y2is a projective measurement, thus in the deﬁnition of the max\nfunction is only to run over all possible POVM decomposition ofMb1y1. And we denoted\nMb1y1to beMb1y1=/summationtext\niλi{Pb1y1}λ1. Typically, in non-locality sharing scenarios, the last\nmeasurement in the sequence is often a projective measureme nt, as it is necessary to\ndestroy the entanglement at the end to obtain maximum non-lo cality. Regarding the\ngeneration of randomness, performing the projective measu rement in the last sequence\ncan also extract additional residual randomness from the ﬁn al post-measurement state.\nIn principle, quantifying randomness requires exploring a ll extreme value\ndecompositions of POVM. However, exploring all extreme val ue decompositions is\nchallenging, especially for high-dimensional systems, an d it is unclear how many extreme\nvalue decompositions a POVME can have. To quantify the amoun t of quantum\nrandomness involved in the sequential CGLMP scenario, we pr ovide a speciﬁc extreme\nPOVM decomposition for the POVM deﬁned in equation ( 21), with the following\ndecomposition:\nPOVM{El\nBm}=εmP0+1−εm\n3P1+1−εm\n3P2+1−εm\n3P3, (27)\nwhereP0={|0/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t0|,|1/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t1|,|2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{t2|},\nP1={|θ0/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ0|,|θ1/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ1|,|θ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ2|},\nP2={|θ1/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ1|,|θ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ2|,|θ0/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ0|},\nP3={|θ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ2|,|θ0/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ0|,|θ1/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tθ1|}.\nAccording to [ 35], the POVM Piare all extremal POVMs. Note that, when the\nbasis ofθis equal to the computational basis, it corresponds to the pa rticular case,\nPOVM{El\nBm}=1+2εm\n3P1+1−εm\n3P2+1−εm\n3P3.\nAlthough we are uncertain if there exist any other forms of ex treme value\ndecompositions for the POVM, based on numerical comparison s in device-independent\nscenarios introduced in the subsequent section, we can infe r that this form may provide\nthe maximum guessing probability, or, to be more precise, yi eld an approximate strategy\nthat generates a guessing probability close to the maximum. Since it is challenging for\nexisting methods to explore all extremal decomposition for ms of POVMs under highdimensional systems in the device-dependent scheme, we cho ose a special extremal\ndecomposition form of POVMs (equation ( 27)) to quantify the quantum intrinsic\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 15\nrandomness under the CGLMP inequality. This decomposition form may not yield\nthe maximum guess probability in the device-dependent sche me. More precisely, our\nPOVM decomposition form is only an approximation strategy f or the maximum guess\nprobability in this scheme. In ﬁgure 4and5, we compare the randomness generated\nby these two schemes. The randomness between them is relativ ely close. Even if there\nare other POVM decomposition strategies, the maximum guess probability obtained by\nthem will be around equation ( 27), but it will not exceed the maximum guess probability\nin the device-independent scheme. In the device-independent scenario, we assume both\nthe state and measurement are untrusted, and employ a numeri cal tool to explore\nall possible decomposition forms, thereby providing an upp er bound of the guessing\nprobability.\nWe begin by considering the maximum entanglement state in th e trusted quantum\nrandomness system scenario, we can get the quantum randomne ss for a given\nmeasurement setting. Except for the local randomness given in the next section in\nﬁgure 4, local randomness refers to the randomness observed in the j oint outcomes of\nvariablesb1andb2. We give the Alice Bob1and Bob2global randomness expression.\nGlobal randomness here refers to the randomness observed in the joint outcomes of\nvariablesa,b1, andb2. Additionally, we conducted a randomness analysis speciﬁc ally\nfor the maximum violation state. Subsequently, we present a comparison of the\nglobal intrinsic randomness between the maximum violation state and the maximum\nentangled state, as illustrated in ﬁgure 3. This comparison is based on the measurement\ndecomposition outlined in the equation ( 27). The results indicate that in the sequential\nCGLMP measurement scenario, the maximum violation state ex hibits a higher degree of\nrandomness compared to the maximum entangled state. Furthe rmore, the randomness\nin the Alice1-Bob1\n1-Bob2\n2measurement is higher than that in the Alice1-Bob1\n1-Bob2\nmeasurement, where the superscript denotes the ordinal num ber of the participant’s\nmeasurement. It should be noted that only the randomness in A lice1-Bob1\n1-Bob2\n2and\nAlice1-Bob1\n1-Bob2\n1measurements are showcased here, but due to symmetry, the sa me\nholds for the randomness in other measurement outcomes as we ll.\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 16\nFigure 3.

Subsequently, we will investi gate the randomness in\nthe context of untrusted devices, demonstrating how trustw orthiness can impact\nquantiﬁable randomness. By comparing the randomness in tru stworthy devices without\ndecomposition information to that in untrusted device scen arios (device-independent)\nwith NPA quantiﬁcation, we aim to provide a comprehensive un derstanding of\nrandomness across diﬀerent levels of trustworthiness, the reby enriching our research.\nIn device-independent quantum random generators, the quan tum systems are\nregarded as black boxes, and no assumptions are made about th e physical dimension\nof the underlying state. Due to the one-to-many mapping betw een classical statistics\nand quantum systems, there can be multiple realizations of t he state and measurements\nthat yield the same statistics. Among these realizations, s ome may provide Eve with\nan advantage in obtaining information about the observed ou tcomes. Therefore, to\nquantify the randomness generated, it is necessary to consi der all possible realizations\nand determine the lower bound on the amount of randomness tha t can be certiﬁed from\nan observed probability distribution in the device-indepe ndent setting.\nHowever, considering all possible realizations of the stat istics poses signiﬁcant\ncomputational challenges, especially when the dimension o f the underlying Hilbert\nspace is unknown. To resolve this technical diﬃculty, Navas cués, Pironio, and Acín\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 17\nfeasibility problem by introducing linear constraints and semideﬁnite constraints. This\ntechnique, commonly referred to as the NPA method, allows fo r eﬀective resolution\nusing semideﬁnite programming algorithms. Building upon t he original NPA hierarchy,\nBowles et al. [ 32] further enhanced the method by incorporating additional s equential\nconstraints, giving rise to the construction of the sequent ial NPA hierarchy. In this\nsection, we leverage the sequential NPA hierarchy to establ ish bounds on the amount of\nrandomness present within observed probability distribut ions, utilizing full probability\nas a constraint. Rather than depending on violation inequal ities, the use of full\nprobabilities as constraints is preferred due to its demons trated optimality in quantifying\nrandomness [ 37,38].\nThe randomness deﬁned is not suitable for untrusted devices anymore, since the\nstate and measurements form are unknown now. We begin by intr oducing Eve’s\nguessing probability as the measure of randomness and then u sing NPA methods\nto provide an upper bound about the maximum guessing probabi lity.The guessing\nprobability for Alice’s input x=x∗and Bob’s input y=y∗, denoted as G(x∗,y∗),\nrefers to the maximum probability that Eve can correctly gue ss both Alice and Bob’s\noutputs while reproducing the observed probability distri butionpAB(a,b1,b2|x,y1,y2)\nwhen marginalizing her output. Mathematically, it is deﬁne d as follows:\nG(x∗,y∗) = max\npABE∈Q/summationdisplay\ne=a,b1,b2p(a,b1,b2,e|x∗,y∗\n1,y∗\n2). (28)\nHere,pABErepresents the joint probability distribution of Alice, Bo b, and Eve’s outputs,\nconstrained within the quantum set Q, which is the set that contains all the quantum\nrealizations. The sum is taken over the possible outcomes efor Eve, which includes\nthe alphabets of Alice and Bob’s outputs, namely a,b1, andb2. Hereeis used to\nrepresent Eve’s guessing outcome of the alphabet of Alice an d Bob’s outputs and its\nsize is determined by the product of the sizes of a,b1, andb2. It should be noted that\nwe assume Eve has no input, as she can use a single measurement that has the size\nof|a| · |b1| · |b2|outputs to guess the outcomes. The observed probability dis tribution\npAB(a,b1,b2|x,y1,y2)is related to the joint distribution pABE(a,b1,b2,e|x,y1,y2)through\nthe following formula:\npAB(a,b1,b2|x,y1,y2) =/summationdisplay\nepABE(a,b1,b2,e|x,y1,y2)\n=pobs(a,b1,b2|x,y1,y2).(29)\nTo obtain an observable probability distribution pobs, we also consider the above scenario\nof one Alice and a sequence of two Bobs, initially sharing the maximum entangled state\nand the maximum violation state. In the device-independent scenario, the underlying\nPOVM taken by all participants as well as the initial shared s tate between Alice and\nBob1are untrustworthy. Therefore, the observed probabilistic statistics can originate\nfrom any quantum subsystem in any dimension. Since mixed sta tes and POVM can be\nextended to pure states and projection systems in higher dim ensions, we only focus on\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 18\nthe implementation of pure state and projection measuremen ts. Therefore, the observed\nprobability has the following quantum realization,\npAB(a,b1,b2|x,y1,y2) =/an}bracketle{tψ|Πa\nx⊗Πb1\ny1Πb2\ny2|ψ/an}bracketri}ht.

The sequential NPA hierarchy introduced\nby Bowles et al is used to run over all the possible pure state |ψ/an}bracketri}htand projective\nmeasurement Πb1y1Πb2y2to upper bound the guessing probability of equation ( 28).\nBefore that, it is necessary to provide the calculation of th e observed statistics in the\nspeciﬁed experiment. The states under consideration are bo th maximum entanglement\nstates and maximum violation states. The POVM in Bob1is deﬁned as given in equation\nEl\nBmy=1+2ε1\n3|l/an}bracketri}htB/an}bracketle{tl|B+1−ε1\n3|l+1 mod 3 /an}bracketri}htB/an}bracketle{tl+1 mod 3 |B\n+1−ε1\n3|l+2 mod 3 /an}bracketri}htB/an}bracketle{tl+2 mod 3 |B.(31)\nIn equation ( 21),I3=|l/an}bracketri}htB/an}bracketle{tl|B+|l+1 mod 3 /an}bracketri}htB/an}bracketle{tl+1 mod 3 |B+|l+2 mod 3 /an}bracketri}htB/an}bracketle{tl+2\nmod 3|B,|l/an}bracketri}htBis expressed by equation ( 19). When |θ0〉, |θ1〉, |θ2〉 in equation ( 27) are\ncomputational basis, equation ( 31) is a special form of equation ( 27). We denote the\ncoeﬃcient and the operators as ε1and{El\nBmy}ε1. The range of values for the coeﬃcient\nǫ1is the range in which the above sequential CGLMP scenario can achieve double\nviolations, then the observed statistics can be calculated as follows:\nG(a,/vectorb|x,/vector y) =/summationdisplay\nltr(ρAB{El\nBmy}ε1)tr({El\nBmy}ε1ρAB{El\nBmy}†\nε1Ma\nx⊗Mb2\ny2)).(32)\nThe quantum randomness for the given measurement setting (x,/vector y)then is quantiﬁed by\nH∞(a/vectorb|x/vector y) =−log2G(a,/vectorb|x,/vector y). (33)\nWe utilize the 1+AB level of the sequential NPA algorithm to q uantify the randomness\nin the sequence CGLMP setup. Given that both mixed states and POVM can be\nextended to pure states and projection systems in higher dim ensions, we focus solely\non the implementation of pure state and projection measurem ents. Consequently, it\nis necessary to introduce 6 operators each to characterize t he measurements of Alice,\nBob1, and Bob2. TheABmoment entails a total of 98 operators, whereas there exist\n36 operators representing the product of operators between Bob1and Bob2. Hence, the\nresulting matrix dimension is 108×108. Additionally, we need to consider introducing\noperators for Eve to characterize Eve’s guessing outcomes. Given the practical scale of\nthe NPA hierarchy for sequences, we limit our examination to local randomness. This\napproach eliminates the need to describe Eve using 27 projec tion operators to guess\nglobal outcomes within the algorithm, opting instead for ju st 9 operators to guess two\nBobs’ outcomes, thereby improving computational eﬃciency . Although the sequential\nNPA allows for the theoretical characterization of global r andomness, the algorithm\nsigniﬁcantly expands in size, leading to slower computatio nal speed.\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 19\nFigure 4. The randomness in the MES, with the given extreme value decom position of POVM\nin equation ( 27) and the sequential NPA hierarchy approach.\nIn ﬁgure 4and ﬁgure 5, we present lower bounds to the logarithm of the negative\naboutG(y∗= (0,1))andG(y∗= (0,0)), namely randomness, calculated using level\n1 + AB of the hierarchy, taking into account the eﬀect of noise . In ﬁgure 4the\nobserved statistics are based on the maximum entanglement s tate, while ﬁgure 5is\nbased on the maximum violation state. We compared the random ness achieved by\ndiﬀerent measurement bases in ﬁgures 4and5. The results show that the randomness\ncorresponding to diﬀerent measurements chosen by Bob1and Bob2is diﬀerent. In\nparticular, the randomness of Bob1\n1and Bob2\n2consistently exceeds that of Bob1\n1and\nBob2\n1, regardless of whether it is the maximum entangled state or t he maximum violation\nstate.\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 20\nFigure 5. The randomness in the MVS, with the given extreme value decom position of POVM\nin equation ( 27) and the sequential NPA hierarchy approach.\nIn ﬁgures 4and5, within the device-trusted scheme, the extreme decomposit ion\nform of equation ( 27) is used to derive the randomness associated with the maximu m\nentangled state and the maximum violation state. In additio n, in the device-independent\nscenario, the sequential NPA hierarchy is used to quantify r andomness. For the setting\nof Bob1\n1and Bob2\n2, it shows that the randomness coming from these two methods i s quite\nclose enough, suggesting the randomness for trusted scenar io is quite close to the one\nfrom our given decomposition ( 27). For the setting of Bob1\n1and Bob2\n1, the randomness\ncoming from those two methods is relatively larger, thus we i nfer there may be more\noptimal decomposition for the setting of Bob1\n1and Bob2\n1or the NPA hierarchy for the\nsetting of Bob1\n1and Bob2\n1is not tight enough.\n4. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present a deﬁnition of quantum intrinsic ra ndomness under\nsequential measurements. To achieve this goal, Eve’s class ical maximum guess\nprobability and the quantum maximum guess probability are p rovided based on the\nvarying degrees of association between the eavesdropper Ev e and the quantum system.\nFurthermore, we have quantiﬁed the quantum intrinsic rando mness under the CGLMP\nsequential measurements scenario at various conﬁdence lev els in the device. In the\ntrusted quantum system scenario, the quantum state is pure, maximum entanglement\nstate or maximum violation state, and only the measurement i s noisy, in which case\nEve has the same maximum quantum guess probability and maxim um classical guess\nprobability, so only POVM extremal decomposition should be considered to quantify\nthe classical guess probability. For POVM in the CGLMP scena rio, we provide a special\nQuantifying the intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements 21\nkind of decomposition and calculate the randomness in the re sult of this decomposition.\nThis special kind of decomposition provides an upper-bound estimate of randomness.\nIn principle, we should run over all the extremal decomposit ion of POVM to quantify\nrandomness. However, providing all decomposition forms is challenging, especially for\nhigh-dimensional POVM. In future studies, we will further e xplore high-dimensional\nPOVM extremum decomposition methods to obtain more accurat e results. In the\nscenario of untrusted quantum systems, both quantum states and measurements may\ncontain noise, we use the sequential NPA hierarchy method to lower the bound of the\nveriﬁable quantiﬁable randomness. In any case, our work imp oses stricter constraints on\nthe deﬁnition of intrinsic randomness in sequential measur ements. It has the potential\nto help improve random number generation rates in practice.\nOur research contributes to understanding the limitations and possibilities of\ngenerating random numbers in sequential measurements in qu antum systems. The\ndeﬁned quantum intrinsic randomness provides a basis for fu rther exploration and\napplications in quantum information processing and crypto graphy. In the future, it\nis possible to extend our results to more non-locality scena rios, including the two-sided\nsequential measurement scenario, semi-device steering sc enario [ 39], and probability\nstatistic criteria as non-locality scenarios [ 40]. It remains to be investigated whether\nthe relationship between sequential intrinsic randomness and sequential nonlocality and\nentanglement is consistent with the standard Bell scenario .\nThis research was supported by the National Nature Science F oundation of China\n(Grants No. 62101600, No. 62201252), the Science Foundatio n of China University of\nPetroleum, Beijing (Grant No. 2462021YJRC008), State Key L aboratory of Cryptology\n(Grant No. MMKFKT202109), and Natural Science Foundation o f Jiangsu Province,\nChina (Grant No. BK20190407).\nWe give the proofs of two theorems in this section.

The aim of this paper, consequently, is to provide software practitioners with tangible leads\ntoward understanding and managing the evolutionary concerns of\ndigital twins. We use four distinct digital twin evolution scenarios,\ncontextualized in a citizen energy community case to illustrate the\nusage of the 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution.

Examples of smart ecosystems include smart\ncities [ 8], smart energy communities [ 9], and smart grids with\nrenewable components [10].\nMuch like natural ecosystems, smart ecosystems are open-ended\nand need to allow for continuous changes in their structure and\nbehavior. These evolutionary dynamics, in turn, challenge the technical sustainability [ 18] of smart ecosystems, i.e., their ability to\nmaintain the quality of service over a prolonged period of time [ 12].\nTo improve the sustainability of smart ecosystems, proper evolution\nmechanisms are required to be put in place. While evolution has a\nsubstantial body of knowledge in model-driven software engineering [6,11], hybrid cyber-physical components of smart ecosystems,\nsuch as digital twins [ 14], give rise to challenges traditional software\nengineering techniques fall short of addressing.\nDigital twins are real-time, virtual representations of physical\nsystem components [ 14]. They govern smart ecosystems and provide essential mechanisms and services to assess, simulate, and\ncontrol the physical infrastructure of smart ecosystems for optimal\nbehavior [ 17]. Thus, to ensure the technical sustainability of smart\necosystems, first, the technical sustainability of digital twins must\nbe managed. Changes in digital twins boil down to a heterogeneous\nset of components, including software, hardware, middleware, and\nIoT devices. The interdependency of concerns severely hinders the\napplicability of software engineering techniques and even challenges the very understanding of evolutionary needs.\nTo help software engineers apply their expertise in digital twin\nevolution scenarios, we provide a case-based demonstration of the\n7R taxonomy in this paper. The 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution [ 4] defines seven elementary activities to support the technical\nsustainability of digital twins.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we elaborate on a\ncase of an evolving smart ecosystem, driven by digital twin evolution. In Sec. 3, we recommend action points to apply the 7R taxonomy. In Sec. 4, we draw the conclusions. We provide background\ninformation about key concepts in sidebars.\n2 CASE: CITIZEN ENERGY COMMUNITY\nTo illustrate the usage of the 7R taxonomy (see sidebar), we rely on\na practical case of an evolving smart ecosystem, called the citizen\nenergy community.\nEnergy communities enable collective, citizen-driven energy\nactions to support a clean energy transition [ 2]. In citizen energy\ncommunities (Fig. 1), citizens and small commercial entities are\nequipped with energy generation andstorage capacity , promoting\nthem to first-class generators of energy. As opposed to traditional\nregulatory models, a citizen energy community gives rise to a smartarXiv:2403.07162v3 [cs.SE] 19 Aug 2024\nMODELS Companion ’24, September 22-27, 2024, Linz, Austria Judith Michael, Istvan David, and Dominik Bork\nThe 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution\nTaxonomies are a form of classification, aiming to systematically\norganize knowledge of a specific research field or problem. Classification of objects helps to understand the specific field and\nsystematically treat a particular problem. The 7R taxonomy of\ndigital twin evolution [ 4] identifies seven areas of action to react\nto the evolutionary needs of digital twins.\nRe-calibration of a model parameter is required when the model\nis not a faithful representation of the physical twin anymore and\nsimulations become incorrect, leading to imprecise assessment,\nanalysis, and control of the physical twin.\nRe-modeling the physical twin might be required in more elaborate cases, e.g., when the model does not reflect the real phenomenon properly. Specific software engineering tasks, such as\nre-architecting re-packaging a software component might be considered as refinements of this R-imperative.\nReconciliation of data, i.e., updating the data schema and migrating data might be needed when data discrepancies occur, and\ndata might become inconsistent.Re-collecting data is needed when events are missed due to\ntransient errors. It might necessitate reconciliation, re-modeling,\nand re-calibration.\nRe-deploying the evolved digital twin is needed after at least\none of the previous steps has been taken.\nRe-configuration of the physical twin is required after the digital twin has evolved. Re-configuration entails a wide range of\npotential actions, from changing the settings of a physical component to the installation of new ones.\nReuse of the large amounts of data, knowledge, and know-how\nthat have been amassed during the operation of the digital twin\nis paramount in ensuring cost-efficient digital twin projects.\necosystem , in which participation is voluntary and egalitarian; and\ncyber-physical components compose the infrastructure.\nA digital twin is developed to govern the smart ecosystem [ 9]\nfrom the very beginning. The digital twin provides stakeholders\nwith tools to monitor and optimize energy trading processes, simulate energy provision and usage scenarios, analyze what-if scenarios, and predict maintenance requirements.\nThroughout the lifespan of the system, new features are developed, new components are added, and core elements-often as\ncritical as a power plant-are retired. In the following, we discuss\nfour evolutionary scenarios in an escalating order of impact. By\ndiscussing the scenarios through the 7R framework of digital twin\nevolution for technical sustainability, we demonstrate how to organize the chain of thought about digital twin evolution into a\nstructured set of arguments to support engineering tasks.\n2.1 Scenario 1: From a monitoring digital twin\nThe local government decided to provide financial incentives to\nresidents, who provide the excess energy of their photovoltaic\nsystems within the citizen energy community network. In the new\nsetting, client end-points do not only consume but also produce\nelectricity. However, this setup necessitates accurate forecasting\nof electricity fluctuations, especially excess electricity to prevent\ndamage, e.g., due to overheating components.\nRe-model. Forecasting excess electricity requires a suitable model\nof the electrical grid. Engineering models that leverage laws of\nphysics are a typical choice. Thus, the grid operator decides to\nimprove the models of the digital twin and re-model the grid by\nadding models of thermodynamics and external factors, such as\natmospheric pressure and relative humidity.\nRe-calibrate. With the new models added, the digital twin needs to\nbe re-calibrated. Without calibration, the models would not matchthe real system, resulting in inaccurate forecasts. Re-calibration is\nachieved by manual tuning based on high-quality operational data\ncollected by the digital twin.\n2.2 Scenario 2: AI-driven predictions\nAfter realizing the benefits of a predictive digital twin-e.g., improved resource efficiency and safety-the grid operator decides to\nfurther improve the predictive capabilities of the digital twin. One\nproblem with the engineering model-based techniques in place is\nthe computing power they require for detailed simulations. As an\nalternative, AI-based predictive methods are proposed and realized.\nRe-collect. The development of the new AI model requires large\nvolumes of data, including data that has not been considered before.\nTypically, data points that were excluded from the manually-built\nengineering models due to increased complexity are now becoming\nof particular interest, such as environmental data (e.g., cloud cover).\nTherefore, the data collection strategy needs to be revised, and the\ndigital twin should start harvesting the required data points.\nReconcile. Collected data needs to pass through various data processing pipelines aiming to clean and consolidate data and eventually store it in a database. The data management infrastructure\nneeds to be reconciled with the newly collected data. This includes technical aspects (e.g., updating data schemas and processing\nscripts); and in some cases, addressing the organizational or legal\nframework (e.g., when working with personal or sensitive data).\nRe-model. After reconciliation, re-modeling is required to generate\nAI-based prediction models that are trained on data from the new\ndata pipelines. The re-modeling, here, concerns the addition of new\ndata quantities and qualities to establish an adequate model for\npredicting the behavior of the energy community using AI.\nRe-calibrate. The evolution of the data and the model require a\nre-calibration of the model to adjust it to the evolved (i.e., extended)\nscope, end eventually, again faithfully reflect the physical twin.\nDigital Twin Evolution for Sustainable Smart Ecosystems MODELS Companion ’24, September 22-27, 2024, Linz, Austria\nFigure 1: Digital Twin of an Energy Citizen Community evolving over time\nA citizen energy community [ 2] is a localized entity, established\nwith the purpose of generating, distributing, supplying, and storing energy. It enables local energy trading and facilitates the\npurchasing and selling of energy and energy services to optimize\nlocal consumption [ 9]. Such a citizen energy community consists\nof citizens, their buildings, small commercial or public entities\nconsuming energy, and different sources producing energy including the citizens and small commercial or public entities. Energy\ncommunities are crucial in driving the clean energy transition.Digital twins of citizen energy communities\nA digital twin of a citizen energy community provides a faithful\nvirtual replica of the overall socio-techno-economic system. By\nthat, the digital twin enables the assessment of key indicators,\ne.g., of sustainability and overall system health, and supports\nthe continuous improvement and evolution of the ecosystem. A\ndigital twin also helps monitor and optimize energy trading processes [ 22], simulate energy provision and usage scenarios, detect\nincorrect sensor information, and predict maintenance tasks of\npower lines, energy storages, or other physical components.\n2.3 Scenario 3: Management of excess energy\nToo much energy can lead to voltage frequency disturbances in the\nsystem. As a result, transformers might trip off to protect themselves from being damaged. This can cause localized blackouts. To\nfurther improve the safety of the grid and optimize its efficiency,\nthe operator decides to equip the grid with the latest generation\nof safety components-sensors that detect potentially hazardous\npatterns, and actuators that can act upon hazardous situations. As\nusual, the digital twin operates these components.\nRe-configure. First, the physical infrastructure of the grid needs\nto be re-configured. This re-configuration concerns putting new\nsensors and actuators in place. The new equipment enables the\ngrid operator to localize causes for inefficient use of the grid and,\nconsequently, to also actuate on identified grid components (e.g.,\ntemporal removal of consumers/producers from the grid, or establishment and enforcement of bandwidth limits).\nRe-collect. As new sensors are in place that are producing data\nnot considered before, the digital twin has to collect these new\ndata points about hazardous situations such as voltage frequency\ndisturbance or energy overload in specific areas of the grid.\nRe-model. For the optimization of the smart grid efficiency, the operators decide to use the existing sensor and actuator components\nand integrate them to realize an agent who is in continuous interaction with the physical components by an actuation and sensingrelationship. In this respect, a new model is created that supports a\nreinforcement learning approach [21].\nRe-calibrate. The new model in support of reinforcement learning\nneeds to be calibrated. This ensures that the model is a faithful\nrepresentation of the grid. Calibration is achieved step-wise, by\ningesting pieces of data as they arrive on the data stream.\nRe-deploy. The data from the added sensors and actuators as well\nas the results of the developed reinforcement learning approach\nshould be visualized to the users of the digital twin. This requires\nthat the digital twin as a software system has to be re-deployed.\n2.4 Scenario 4: Retiring the coal power plant\nEventually, the distributed citizen energy community reaches the\nlevel of self-sustainability, efficiency, and safety, where the central\ncoal power plant component is not needed anymore; and political\ntrends drive the obsolescence of coal-fired power generation. As\na consequence, the coal power plant is retired. The digital twin,\nhowever, is a source of important information thanks to the data\ncollected throughout the lifespan of the coal power plant. Additionally, legal constraints require the grid operator to keep this data for\nseveral years for documentation purposes.\nReuse. The grid operator is now able to reuse important design\ndocuments, design rationale (engineering decisions), experimental\nsimulation traces, and operative information collected by the digital\nMODELS Companion ’24, September 22-27, 2024, Linz, Austria Judith Michael, Istvan David, and Dominik Bork\nTable 1: Primary roles of Software Engineering in Digital Twin Evolution\nR-imperativeInvolvement of software engineers\nRe-calibrate Update models.

Transfer learning from AI components.\ntwin during the lifespan of the original power plant. However,\neffective reuse might require further actions, e.g., re-calibrating\nmodels or re-collecting additional data.\nHere, we maintain a focus on software aspects. In a system-wide\nfocus, resource value retention options would become additionally\nimportant [ 1,5], e.g., reusing particular components of a power\nplant, repairing or replacing parts in the smart grid, or re-purposing\nbuildings leading to changed energy needs.\n3 ACTION POINTS FOR APPLICATION\nWe aim to ease the application of the 7R taxonomy for digital twin\nevolution. Generally, applying the taxonomy requires answering\ntwo questions related to the affected R-imperatives on the one hand\nand the existing evolutionary processes on the other.\n3.1 Which of the R-imperatives does an\nevolutionary scenario touch upon?\nAnswering this question helps in understanding the primary roles\nof software engineering in support of digital twin evolution, and the\nextent to which software engineering is involved in these phases.\nTab. 1 provides typical examples of such roles to every R-imperative.\nRe-calibration. This imperative often does not require the involvement of model engineers and scientists; software engineers who are\nfamiliar with the model might take care of re-calibration in their\nown scope. Calibration and re-calibration of models is a moderately\nsoftware-intensive R-imperative ( ).\nRe-modeling. This imperative, on the other hand, is primarily the\nconcern of model engineers and scientists. The role of software\nengineers is to take such models and refactor them for scalability.\nThis is typical, e.g., with machine learning models, in which algorithms are fine-tuned by scientists, enabling software engineers to\nintegrate the model into the software architecture. Re-modeling is\none of the least software-intensive R-imperatives ( ).\nRe-collecting. Re-collecting data typically requires working with\ndevice APIs or interacting with a messaging middleware. It is a fairly\nsoftware-intensive imperative ( ) that touches upon distributed\ncomponents and often runs into testing challenges.\nReconciliation. The software engineering effort focuses on maintaining data management pipelines as the underlying data collection infrastructure changes. This is a fairly critical and softwareintensive imperative ( ), as it touches upon data, a key value driver\nfor companies [15].Re-deployment. This imperative is typically the most software engineering-intensive one ( ). As computing is typically located in\nthe cloud nowadays, software engineers need to define the overall\ninfrastructure-as-a-code [ 20] for deployment, as well as enact the\nend-to-end DevOps or, in rare cases, CI/CD processes.\nRe-configuration. Re-configuration of the physical infrastructure\nmostly requires interacting with middleware as physical components are mostly hidden behind messaging and procedural layers.\nOccasionally, developing and maintaining embedded software for\nphysical devices might be required, which is typical in specialized\ncases, e.g., where custom measurement equipment is used. Still, this\nimperative is only moderately software-intensive ( ).\nReuse. This imperative can be supported by software engineering [16] by proper componentization of software, preparing it to be\nused in other digital twinning projects. AI-heavy companies might\nwant to retain value from their previously trained AI components\nby transfer learning [ 7]. As reuse in digital twin settings is a more\npressing challenge on the physical side of things, this R-imperative\nis one of the least software-intensive tasks ( ).\n3.2 What are the processes in the organization?\nAnswering this question helps organize the R-imperatives into a coherent flow. Taxonomies only define a classification of concepts and\ndefer the operationalization to the specific context of the organization or company. Thus, a process model or DevOps variant [ 3] is\nrequired to operationalize the taxonomy. These operationalizations\nmight differ in their extent, intent, and vendor dependence.\nExtent: short versus long loops. In the demonstrative case, Scenario\n1 is a relatively short loop. It requires implementing a new model\nand re-calibrating it. In contrast, Scenario 3 is a more elaborate\none, touching upon all but one R-imperative. Clearly, the shorter\nthe loop, the easier it is to oversee and manage. Evidence from the\nindustry also shows that shorter loops, especially on the digital\nside of things (i.e., touching upon re-modeling, re-calibration, and\nre-deployment), are more frequently situated within the traditional\nrealm of software engineering companies. Longer loops tend to\nextend into other domains and require more elaborate cooperation.\nIntent: data-first versus model-first. In the demonstrative case, we\nshow one particular sequence of R-imperatives for each scenario.\nIn practice, R-imperatives can be chained in a different order and\nwith more cycles to achieve the evolutionary goals of digital twins.\nDigital Twin Evolution for Sustainable Smart Ecosystems MODELS Companion ’24, September 22-27, 2024, Linz, Austria\nOften, the preferred order of R-imperatives depends on company\nbest practices and employed paradigms.\nFigure 2: Operationalizations of the taxonomy in Scenario 3\nFig. 2 shows two typical operationalizations of Scenario 3. In\nadata-first approach, the physical twin is re-configured, and subsequently, data collection and reconciliation start immediately to\ndrive model creation in a deductive fashion. The discussion of\nScenario 3 in the running example followed a data-first view. Alternatively, in a model-first approach, the re-configuration of the\nphysical twin is followed by re-modeling, re-calibration, and redeployment of the digital twin. The benefit of this approach is that\nmodels can be used to re-generate data schemas and processing\nscripts, and thus, data collection can commence smoothly, almost\nwithout manual intervention. Software companies adopting modeldriven practices [ 19] might venture into model-first evolutionary\nprocesses, but the data-first mindset is still prevalent in practice.\nVendor dependence. Operating smart ecosystems is seldom a oneperson show. Software companies work with various vendors. Increasingly more often, equipment vendors ship devices coupled\nwith models pre-configured with reasonable defaults. In such cases,\nlonger loops are to be expected, and re-modeling, re-calibration,\nand re-configuration tasks, in particular, need to be scheduled appropriately. In contrast, internal re-modeling and re-calibration\nspeed up the process but pose challenges in technical aspects, such\nas maintenance, and non-functional aspects, such as certification.\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper provides a case-based introduction to the application\nof the 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution. We focus on the role\nof software engineering in the key tasks outlined by the taxonomy\n(i.e., its R-imperatives).\nUltimately, the 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution fosters\nbetter decisions in a convoluted problem space in which software\nengineers are key to success. There are many benefits software\nengineers can gain from using the taxonomy.\nComprehensive arguments. Scenarios can be explained in a structured way through the taxonomy, leading to more comprehensive\narguments. The taxonomy defines the main concerns of digital twin\nevolution, and by explaining the scenarios through these concerns,\nthe engineers can make sure they think of every important aspect.\nUnderstanding the impact of change. The length of loops is indicative\nof the complexity of change and how demanding the evolution of\nthe digital twin is. However, more comprehensive and structured\nimpact analysis methods are required, given the critical natureof smart ecosystems. In the interim, we recommend relying on\nestablished cause-effect modeling techniques.\nMostly manual evolution. Mostly due to the physical components.\nScenario 1 could have been addressed by putting the right change\nmechanisms in place. However, Scenario 2 showed that evolution\ncan quickly escalate into the physical realm. Thus, better automation support for digital-physical co-evolution is required.\nGuizzardi, and Henderik Proper. 2024. The Role of Modeling in the Analysis\nand the Design of Sustainable Systems.

Hence, the most adequate choice is to use local planning or local\nplanning alongside global planning. When designing optimal motion planning\nboth local and global, the key metrics to bear in mind are execution time,\nasymptotic optimality, and quick reaction to dynamic obstacles. Such planning\napproaches can address the aforesaid target metrics more e\u000eciently compared\nto other approaches such as path planning followed by smoothing. Thus, the\nforemost objective of this study is to analyse related literature in order to understand how the motion planning, especially trajectory planning, problem is\nformulated, when being applied for generating optimal trajectories in real-time\nfor Multirotor Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), impacts the listed metrics.

Introduction\nAdroit motion planning of \rying little creatures, such as birds and butter\ries,\nis an extraordinarily demanding task for several reasons, including aggressive\nmaneuver. An example of such high-speed maneuver need is one in particularly 45\ntight spots where the environment is obstacle-rich. Researchers have been trying\nto replicate similar maneuvers using two di\u000berent types of aerial vehicles: conventional and unconventional. In this research we deal with conventional areal\nvehicles, for instance, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Multirotor Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), etc. Recent progression in computation capabilities and em50\nbedded sensing has been boosting the procedure of mimicking natural \rying\nanimals; this advancement has enabled plenty of new opportunities in diverse\nelds: inspection, autonomous transportation, logistics, delivery, areal photography, post-disaster and medical services. Yet optimal motion planning remains\na crucial task in all the \felds listed above. In optimal motion planning, the en55\nvironmental reasoning can not be predictable since environmental conditions\nchange rapidly. Hence, there are various challenges to be addressed to obtain\nhighly e\u000ecient and optimal motion planning. In this paper, we mainly focus\non how researchers have been addressing these challenges in optimal motion\nplanning to obtain robust navigation in various domains for MAVs. 60\nIn most of the foregoing applications, the environment is entirely or partially\nunexplored. Furthermore, unpredictable events can occur at any time due for\nnumerous reasons. Thus, to tackle those unexpected problems in real time, a\nfast and accurate optimal motion planning technique is required. In general,\nthe optimal motion planning problem is divided into a few subcategories: path 65\nplanning followed by smoothing, kinodynamic search-based trajectory generation, and motion primitive-based approaches. Among them, plan-based control\napproaches are the most widely used and e\u000ecient way to address the considered\nproblem compared to the other two approaches. Plenty of plan-based control\nstrategies have been proposed throughout the recent decade, showing promis70\ning results; this is one of the key motivating factors for reviewing plan-based\ncontrol, especially for industrial MAVs. Most of the industrial MAVs such as\nquadrotors have their low-level controllers, for example, PX4 [1], DJI [2], that\ncan be operated independently irrespective of high-level execution commands.\nMoreover, such controllers reduce the overhead and complexity for developing 75\nhigh-level planning algorithms due to their independence. In other words, the\nsame planner can be deployed on di\u000berent \frmware by implementing an interface between a high-level planner and a low-level controller. Thus, we narrowed\ndown our study to considering only plan-based control approaches (Fig. 1), particularly in application to industrial MAVs. 80\nFigure 1: The overview of plan-based control paradigm in the context of trajectory planning\nproblem formulation.

Hence, a MAV should be\ncapable of executing robust, agile, aggressive maneuver while ensuring dynamic\nfeasibility and guaranteeing smoothness of the trajectory in low \right time.\nFurthermore, trajectory plotting should be performed within an obstacle-free\nzone at high-speed to handle a given mission e\u000bectively. Such behaviour is im85\nposed by adhering to a set of constraints. If and only if the constraints are\nincorporated appropriately, desired needs can be ful\flled. Obtaining the right\nconstraints at the right moment and applying appropriate control sequences to\nimprove motion quality is the key objective of any plan-based control approach.\nYet the procedure of obtaining such right constraints is an open research prob90\nlem due to its complexity and numerous other challenges that should be handled simultaneously. For example, Multirotor Aerial Vehicle (MAV) has been\nwidely employed in video-making related \felds in recent years, cinematographic\naerial shooting being one of the popular areas of interest during the last \fve\nyears. In such shooting, generating smooth, obstacle-free trajectories is the 95\nmain challenge. Besides, various other challenges exist, and most of them are\napplication-speci\fc. In this work, we examine the most common problems related to trajectory planning applications in the paradigm of plan-based control,\nand how researchers have been alleviating those problems by proposing compelling solutions. 100\nIn optimal trajectory planning, trajectory generation and controlling the\nMAV are strongly interconnected. For MAVs, the trajectory generation process\nis relatively easy due to the dynamic properties of the MAVs. When dynamic\nobstacles are incorporated, the trajectory has to be re\fned at a high rate in order\nto keep a smooth maneuver despite increased computational demands. More105\nover, understanding close-in obstacles' positions relative to the MAV is crucial\nfor making decisions in real-time; this arises a new challenge: the one of the\nrapidity and accuracy of relative environment reconstruction, which essentially\nis how obstacles constraints are added to the problem formulation. Yet another\nchallenge is of the impact of the obstacles and constraints on the smoothness 110\nand dynamic feasibility of the generated trajectory. After conducting an extensive literature review on the topic of trajectory planning for MAVs, we were able\nto isolate basic building blocks that are essential for optimal motion planning\nas shown in Fig. 2. Each of the primary components plays a key role in the\nprocess of trajectory generation. The rest of the paper focuses on understand115\ning how those building blocks are interconnected in solving trajectory planning\nproblems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 explains what type of\nmotion model is likely to be suitable for de\fning the dynamics of MAV based on\nthe chosen trajectory generation technique. Then, state-of-the-art techniques on 120\nhow to \fnd initial tentative waypoints for trajectory generation is explained in\ntechniques. Section 5 explains how free space is extracted and incorporated into\ntrajectory planning. The trajectory re\fnement process is explained in section. 6.\nHorizon-based trajectory planning techniques are described in section 7. Various 125\nsolvers which can be used to solve the optimization problem are detailed under\n2. Motion Model Selection\nExact model, empirical model and di\u000berential \ratness are the main techniques that can be employed for selecting the most appropriate motion model 130\nfor a speci\fed application. The appropriate motion model selection procedure\nvaries depending on the problem formulation. For example, planning followed\nby controlling approaches does not necessarily have an exact motion model\nmainly due to high computational demands. In such scenarios, an empirical\nmotion model is su\u000ecient for planning, since a dedicated controller is utilized 135\nfor controlling the quadrotor.\n2.1. Exact Model\nIn general, MAV dynamics is described by 12-DOF. However, in planning\nfollowed by high-level controlling approaches, it is not required to de\fne an\nactual motion model for planning, since a high-level controller consists of a 140\nfullyedged quadrotor motion model. In most circumstances, the planner is\ncomprised of approximated quadrotor dynamics; this is due to computational\ncomplexity, which is not adequate for real-time onboard processing. Hence,\nthe motion model selection process depends on the approach that formulates\nneeds. In [6], the researchers proposed a 12-DOF motion model whose state 145\nvector is de\fned by x= [p>;v>; >;!>], where ,p,vand!stand for\norientation (rad), position (m), velocity (m/s) and angular velocity (rad/s)\ninR3, respectively. The system input or total trust that is applied for each\nof the motors is given by f= [f1;f2;f3;f4]T(N). System dynamics is determined as _x= [_p>;_v>;_ >;_!>], where _p=v,_v=\u0000g\u0001ez+(f\u0001exp [ ]\u0001ez\u0000kv\u0001v)\nm, 150\n_ =!+1\n2[ ]\u0001!+(1\u00001\n2k k\ntan(1\n2k k))[ ]2\u0001!=k k2, _!=J\u00001(\u001a(f2\u0000f4)ex)+\u001a(f3\u0000\nf1)ey+km(f1\u0000f2+f3\u0000f4)ez\u0000[!]\u0001J\u0001w),g= 9:8ms\u00002andei; i=x;y;z stand\nfor standard basis vectors in R3,kv;m;J;\u001a andkmare robot speci\fc constants.\n2.2. Empirical Model\nOther than the exact model, a 6-DOF motion model was proposed for gov155\nerning quadrotor in a distributed setup [69]. Later, it was reduced to 4-DOF\nmotion model [5]. Furthermore, in [70], a 4-DOF motion was used for controlling\nseveral quadrotors in a distributed setup in which NMPC and Model Horizon\nEstimation (MHE) are incorporated for relative tracking where the relative motion model was de\fned as: 160\n_x=fc(x;u; z) =2\n6666664_px\n_py\n_pz\n_ z3\n7777775=2\n6666664vxcos( z)\u0000vysin( z)\u0000\u0016vx+py\u0016_ z\nvxsin( z) +vycos( z)\u0000\u0016vy\u0000px\u0016_ z\nvz\u0000\u0016vz\n_ z\u0000\u0016_ z3\n7777775; (1)\nwhere the function fc(\u0001) :Rnu\u0002Rnx\u0002Rnru!Rnxandnx=nu=nru= 4. The\ncurrent control input is given by u= [vx;vy;vz;_ z], whereas relative control\ninput uruis denoted by [ \u0016vx;\u0016vy;\u0016vz;\u0016_ z].x= [px;py;pz; z] is the state of the\nmotion model, where pi;i2fx;y;zgis the position of the MAV in the world\nframe. zand \u0016 zdenote the yaw angle or heading angle around the z axis and\nrelative yaw angle, respectively. Derivative of zand \u0016 zare denoted by _ zand\n\u0016_ z, respectively. vi;i2fx;y;zgdenote the velocities on each direction, whereas\n_pi;i2fx;y;zggives the derivatives of pi. Since discrete space was chosen for\ncontrolling the system, Euler discrete model (1) was formulated as follows:\nx+=fd(x;u; z) =2\n6666664px\npy\npz\nz3\n7777775+\u000e2\n6666664vxcos( z)\u0000vysin( z)\u0000\u0016vx+y\u0016_ z\nvxsin( z) +vycos( z)\u0000\u0016vy\u0000x\u0016_ z\nvz\u0000\u0016vz\n_ z\u0000\u0016_ z3\n7777775;(2)\nwhere\u000eis the sampling period and fd(\u0001) :Rnx\u0002Rnu\u0002Rnru!Rnx.fcand\nfddenote continuous and discrete dynamics, respectively. x+depicts the next\nstate given the current state x. Subsequently, the motion model was simpli\fed\nto 4-DOF for trajectory tracking for a quadrotor [71, eq.(1)]. In this trajectorytracking approach, planning followed by the high-level controlling paradigm was\napplied. Such an approach was introduced because a simpli\fed motion model\nis a reasonable choice for achieving real-time performance. Quadrotor state was\nde\fned as x= [px;py;pz; z]T2Rnx, whereas input to the system was given\nbyu= [vx;vy;vz;_ z]T2Rnu. The simpli\fed motion model was given by\n_x=fc(x;u) =2\n6666664_px\n_py\n_pz\n_ z3\n7777775=2\n6666664vxcos( z)\u0000vysin( z)\nvxsin( z) +vycos( z)\nvz\n_ z3\n7777775; (3)\nwhere fc(\u0001) :Rnx\u0002Rnu!Rnxandnx=nu= 4. The discretization of (3) was\ngiven by:\nx+=fd(x;u) =2\n6666664px\npy\npz\nz3\n7777775+\u000e2\n6666664vxcos( z)\u0000vysin( z)\nvxsin( z) +vycos( z)\nvz\n_ z3\n7777775; (4)\nwhere fd(\u0001) :Rnx\u0002Rnu!Rnx.\n2.3. Di\u000berential Fatness\nHere di\u000berential \ratness [72] provides algebraic functions (e.g., polynomials)\nwhich analytically map the trajectory and whose higher-order derivatives map to\nsystem states and inputs. Since the Nth order polynomial can be di\u000berentiated\nup to N-1 times, the di\u000berential fatness property ensures the feasibility of the\ntrajectory and generates appropriate control commands. More precisely, let\n_x=fc(x;u)x2Rnx;u2Rnu: (5)\nbe a nonlinear system. According to to [73], if the system is di\u000berentially \rat,\nthere always exists a \rat output, namely z2Rnz, where the dimension of\nthe output is given by nz. In such a system, states and control inputs can 165\nalso be formulated from the system \rat outputs whose derivatives are mapped\nthrough functions, namely %and\u001c. Let z==(x;u;_u;:::;u(q)) be the \rat\noutput, holding x=%(z;_z;:::;z(r)) and u=\u001c(z;_z;:::;z(r)), where apices(i)\nstipulates the ith derivative. Along with that, the explicit trajectory generation\nprocess can bene\ft when it uses di\u000berentially \rat systems, for example, %and 170\ncan be a dth order polynomial p(t). Then, x>(t) = [p>(t) _p>(t) p>(t)] be\nthe state of the system at time tin which _pTand pTindicate the velocity\nand acceleration of the system, respectively. Control inputs can be determined\nby jerk [74], namely...pT(t) wherep(t) =\u0015dtd+:::+\u00151t+\u00150; t2[0;dt],\nwhere\u0015i;i= 0;:::;d are the polynomial coe\u000ecients. There are various ways to 175\nconstruct these kinds of polynomials, including Minimum-snap, B-spline, etc.\n3. Initial Waypoints Identi\fcation\nGenerally speaking, robots have a limited sensing range. So, planning a\ntrajectory out of such a sensing range would be counterproductive. Hence,\nlocal trajectory planning and re\fnement when a robot moves is the optimal 180\nchoice. With the help of sensing capabilities within the robots' sensing range,\nthe robot's surrounded environment can be constructed as the intersection of\nthree separate disjoint sets: free-known ( Cfree), occupied ( Cobs) and unknown\n(Cunknown ). OnceCfree[Cunknown is identi\fed, a set of intermediate waypoints\nis needed to navigate the robot along the trajectory from the start position to 185\nthe desired position. There are various techniques for \fnding a set of intermediate waypoints: sampling-based techniques (e.g., RRT*, Probabilistic Road Map\n(PRM)), path-searching techniques (e.g., A*, D*, JPS) and so forth. Moreover,\nkinodynamic properties are incorporated into preceding intermediate waypoints\nnding techniques to ensure the dynamic feasibility of the robot. One of the 190\nrst kinodynamic-based path planning approaches was proposed in [75] in which\na variant of the A* method alongside with kinodynamic properties was applied\nto ensure the dynamic feasibility. Subsequently, several di\u000berent methods were\nproposed for enhancing path planning, ensuring the dynamic feasibility by kinodynamic properties, including motion primitive-based approaches. 195\nMotion primitive-based approaches( [56, 76, 77]) can be utilized for \fnding\nintermediate waypoints and for trajectory generation. Gordon et al. [78] proposed a set of motion primitives for connecting edges of the graph that was\nconstructed from A*. In this method, motion primitives were used to de\fning\nstate vector x(t) and control input u(t) as a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system\nas follows:\nxi(t) = [pi(t)>;_pi(t)>;:::;p(kr\u00001)\ni (t)>]>2xi(t)\u001aR3\u0002kr;\npi(t) = [px(t);py(t);pz(t)]T;ui(t) =p(kr)(t);(6)\nwhere p\u0016(t) = \u0006d\nj=0\u0015jtj; \u00162fx;y;zg, which is formulated similar to (16),\nwhilekranddare the order of the derivative and the order of the polynomial,\nrespectively.\n_xi(t) =Axi(t) +Bui(t);\nA=2\n66666666640I30\u0001\u0001\u0001 0\n0 0I3\u0001\u0001\u0001 0\n...............\n0::: ::: 0I3\n0::: ::: 0 03\n7777777775; B =2\nI33\n7777777775:(7)\nHence, given control policy ui(t) and initial state x(0), a sequence of succeeding\nxi(t) =eAtx(0) +Zt\n0eA(t\u0000\r)Bu(\r)d\r; (8)\nwhere\ris the time duration that control policy is applied. In [78], to de\fne the\nactual and heuristic cost of A*, the researchers used motion primitives, which\nare de\fned (as shown) in (8), and calculated initial waypoints set.\nAnother interesting approach to \fnding a set of initial intermediate waypoints is by using fast marching methods. In general, fast marching methods [79]\nare applied to track the propagation of a convoluted interface such as wavefront,\nespecially in image processing. Let 'be a close curve in a plane 2R3that propagates orthogonally to the plane with a speed v(p), assumev >0. Given5T\ntime period, propagation of the plane can be described by j5T(x)j=1\nv(p)based\non Eikonal partial di\u000berential equation [80] where pis the position in R3and\nthe arrival time is formulated by T(x). Fast marching concept was applied for\npath searching in [14] by proposing a method for calculating velocity map. In\nthis method, the arrival time was determined by assessing the desired velocity\nat the considered position. Hence, arrival time was calculated by backtracking\nfrom the goal pose to the start pose along the minimum cost path, which can be\nestimated from the gradient descendant. Though gradient descendant may trap\nin a local minimum, when smart marching is applied, gradient descendant does\nnot trap in local minimum due to fast marching nature; this property was proved\nin [81]. To de\fne the velocity map, ESDF was utilized to get the closest obstacle\nposes from the given pose. A quadrotor should move faster when there are no\nclose-in obstacles and should be slower when it is moving through a cluttered\nenvironment. Such a behaviour was mimicked by incorporating a hyperbolic\ntangential function, i.e., tanh. With such an assumption, the corresponding\nvelocity was calculated based on (9)\nv(l) =8\n<\n:vmax(tanh(l\u0000e) + 1)=2;0\u0014l\n0; l< 0; (9)\nwherevmaxis the maximum velocity a quadrotor can \ry, l is the distance to the\nclosest obstacle from the considered pose pand e is Euler's constant. 200\n4. Initial Trajectory Generation\nLet us consider a non-linear system in the form of _x(t) =fc(x(t);u(t)) with\ninitial state x(t0) =x0, where state vector and control inputs are denoted by\nx2Rnxandu2Rnu, respectively. When generating an initial trajectory (\u0000),\nensuring dynamic feasibility is a must. In other words, xandusatisfy the\nfollowing constraints:\nx2X\u0012Rnx;u2U\u0012Rnu(10)\nIn addition to these constraints, safety constraints should also be imposed after\nreasoning the environment, to guarantee safety. The environment or con\fguration space C can be decomposed into CobsandCfree. Hence, a set of constraints should be introduced for the quadrotor to always be within free space 205\nx2Cfree=C= Cobs. Hence, the initial trajectory generation process has to\nconsider both said types of constraints simultaneously so that the quadrotor\nwould have a smooth \rying experience.\n4.1. De\fne Trajectory\nLet \u0000 C\u001aRdbe an initial trajectory, which is parameterized as a 210\nfunction of time where d denotes the C's dimension. Since \u0000 is a function, the\nobjective of the trajectory generator is to determine the precise objective, which\nwill eventually provide the optimal trajectory in a timely manner satisfying\nconstraints and hypotheses that are imposed. Hence, optimal trajectory, namely\n\u0000\u0003, can be posed as a discrete or continuous OCP [82]: 215\n\u0000\u0003= min\nu(\u0001)J(x(0);u(\u0001))\ns.t.x(0) = x0;x(tn) =xn\n_x(t) =fc(x(t);u(t))\nx(t)2Cfree;u(t)2U; t2[t0;tn];(11)\nwheret0andtndenote the start and terminal time, respectively. Yet another\nchallenging problem is to formulate the objective function, namely J. In the\nfollowing subsections, we discuss several approaches to address this problem.\n4.2. Minimum-snap based Trajectory Generation\nMinimum-snap trajectory generation [3] uses the di\u000berential \ratness property (section 2.3) to automate the trajectory generation process. Let quadrotor trajectory be \u0000 T(t) = [rT(t); T(t)]Tfor \rat output [ x;y;z; z]Twhere\nr= [x;y;z ] is the center position of the MAV with respect to world coordinate\nsystem and zis the yaw angle of the MAV. The continuous trajectory can be\nexpressed as follows:\n\u0000(t) : [t0;tn] Rd; (12)\nwheredis the dimension of the space, e.g., 3. As we de\fned in section 2.3, 220\nsystem states and inputs can be determined in terms of \u0000 and its derivatives.\n\u0000;_\u0000 and \u0000 will correspond to position, velocity and acceleration, respectively.\nFlat output and its derivatives estimation in Minimum-snap refer to the original\nwork [3, eqs. (1-35)].\nIn Minimum-snap trajectory parameterization, the total time duration of the\ntrajectory is divided into a set of sub-intervals, i.e., keyframes. Each keyframe\nconsists of a desired position and a yaw angle. A safe corridor is constructed\nbetween consecutive keyframes as a set of piecewise polynomial functions to\nestimate smooth transitions through the keyframes. Let mdanddbe the number\nof keyframes and the order of the piecewise polynomial functions, respectively.\nHence, \u0000T(t) can be formulated as\n\u0000T(t) =8\n>>>>>><\n>>>>>>:\u0006d\ni=0\u0000i;1(t\u0000t0)it0\u0014t<t 1\n\u0006d\ni=0\u0000i;2(t\u0000t1)it1\u0014t<t 2\n\u0006d\ni=0\u0000i;md(t\u0000tmd\u00001)itmd\u00001\u0014t<tmd: (13)\nTo generate an optimal trajectory, the following objective is utilized:\nJ(rT; T) =Ztmd\nt0\u0018r\r\r\r\rdkrrT\ndtkr\r\r\r\r2\ndt+\u0018 dk T\ndtk 2\ndt\nwJ(rT; T)\ns.t. \u0000T(ti) = \u0000ii= 1;:::;md\ndtpjt=tj\u00140j= 0;md;p= 1;:::;kr\ndtpjt=tj\u00140j= 0;md;p= 1;:::;kr\ndtpjt=tj\u00140j= 0;md;p= 1;:::;kr\ndtpjt=tj\u00140j= 0;md;p= 1;:::;k ;(14)\nwhere\u0018rand\u0018 are regulation parameters, krandk are the order of derivation at each keyframe and \u0000 T(ti) = [xi;yi;zi; zi]T;i= 0;:::;T . Time intervals,\nt1;t2;:::;tmdcan be kept constant or varying when deriving the Minimum-snap\ntrajectory generation. In most cases, having varying time intervals between\nkeyframes is necessary. Mellinger et al. [3] proposed a gradient descent-based\napproach for \fnding optimal time intervals between keyframes. Further, Chen\net al. [13] utilized A* to \fnd the intermediate waypoints. Based on these estimations, time segments or keyframes are calculated incorporating both velocity\nand acceleration limits. In the latter approach, the steps listed below were used\nto obtain intermediate waypoints. Initially, the environment was constructed as\na map using OctoMap. Afterwards, the formed map was split into two subsets:\nallocated and non-allocated (a set of free spaces). Then, the discrete graph\nwas constructed connecting consecutive free spaces, which were represented as\ncubes. Afterwards, A* was applied for \fnding the optimal path segment within\neach cube. Similar to (14), the researchers set kr= 3 and minimized only total\njerk (15) to minimize the angular velocity. As an aside, minimizing the angular\nvelocity helps to avoid fast rotation.\nJ=Ztmd\nt0\u0018r\r\r\r\rdkr\u0000T(t)\ndtkr\r\r\r\r2\ndt: (15)\n4.3. Polynomial Trajectory Generation as QP 225\nIn Minimum-snap trajectory generation, total trust force, i.e., attitude acceleration, is proportional to the fourth derivative (snap) of the trajectory [3]. The\ngracefulness of such behaviour helps to avoid generating excessive control commands. Subsequently, a slight variation of Minimum-snap trajectory generation\nwas proposed in [51], where segment times or keyframes were \fxed initially.\nOnce start and goal positions were provided, RRT* [22] was utilized for \fnding an obstacle-free path between the start and the goal poses as a sequence\nof optimal waypoints. Initial segment times ( md), which were estimated using\noptimal waypoints, were calculated according to the maximum velocities that\nthe quadrotor is allowed to \ry due to set technical limits. Let pi(t) be thedth\norder polynomial in the ith segment that describes as follows:\npi(t) =\u00150t0+\u00151t1+\u00152t2+\u00153t3+:::+\u0015dtd: (16)\nEachpi(t) provides a \rat output for a given time index t. \u0015j;j= 0;:::;d denotes\nthe polynomial coe\u000ecients. The objective or cost function J(\u0000i) can be fully\ndetermined by penalizing the derivatives of squares [51]:\nJ(\u0000i) =Zti+1\nti\u00180pi(t)2+\u00181_pi(t)2+\u00182pi(t)2+:::+\u0018krp(ki\nr)(t)2=PT\niQ(Ti)Pi;(17)\nwherePiis a vector whose elements contain polynomial coe\u000ecients: \u00180;\u00181;:::;\u0018kir,\nki\nris the highest order of derivative and Q(Ti) is Hassin matrix, which contains\nthe ith segment squares of derivatives. Since there are mdnumber of segments,\ntotal costJ(\u0000) can be expressed by\nJ(\u0000) =2\n6664P1\nPmd3\n7775T2\n6664Q(T1)\nQ(Tmd)3\n6664P1\nPmd3\n7775: (18)\nFor a smooth \right experience, ensuring the continuity of derivatives between\nsegments is necessary. Hence, imposing constraints between segments, e.g.,\nvelocity, acceleration, jerk and snap is needed, which can be formulated as\nfollows:\nCipi=di; Ci=2\n4\u00180\n\u0018kr3\ni;di=2\n4d0\ndkr3\ni; (19)\nwhereCicontains a mapping matrix whose entries contain the start and end\ncoe\u000ecients of ith segment, whereas dicontains derivative values, i.e., start and\nend of ith segment. Taking all constraints of mnsegments,\nC2\n6664p1\npmd3\n7775=2\n6664d1\ndmd3\n7775: (20)\nNow this can be solved as a constrained QP problem.\n4.4. Unconstrained Polynomial Trajectory Generation\nThe techniques that are used for uconstrained trajectory optimization are\nfaster than constraints optimization. In [51], the researchers extended Minimumsnap trajectory generation as an unconstrained QP. According to their \fndings,\nMinimum-snap works well for small segments size. For higher-order polynomials with varying segment sizes, Minimum-snap becomes ill-conditioned. Thus,\nan unconstrained QP was proposed. After substituting (19) and (20) into (18),\nJ(\u0000) can be reformulated as\nJ(\u0000) =2\n6664d1\ndmd3\n7775T\n|{z}\nd2\n6664C(T1)\nC(Tmd)3\n7775\u0000T\n|{z}\nC\u0000T2\n6664Q(T1)\nQ(Tmd)3\n|{z}\nQ\n6664C(T1)\nC(Tmd)3\n7775\u000012\n6664d1\ndmd3\n=2\n4df\ndp3\n5T\nSC\u0000TQC\u00001ST\n|{z}\nR2\n4df\ndp3\n5=2\n4df\ndp3\n5T2\n4RffRfp\nRpfRpp3\n4df\ndp3\n5;(21)\nwhere dcontains \fxed derivatives ( df) and free derivatives ( dp), S is a permutation matrix (ones and zeros), which is used to correct the order. Then,\ndJ(\u0000)\nddp= 0 yields the optimal value for dp:\nd\u0003\np=\u0000R\u00001\nfpdf: (22)\nOnce dpis determined, a polynomial that corresponds to each segment can be\nrecovered.\n4.5. Unconstrained Polynomial Trajectory Generation with Collision Avoidance 230\nOleynikova et al. [53] extended what Richter [51] proposed for adding support\nfor collision avoidance capabilities. They added additional term for calculating\nthe collision cost,\nJ(\u0000) =\u0018obsJobs(\u0000) +\u0018smoothJsmooth (\u0000);\nJsmooth =dT\nfRff+dT\nfRfpdp+dpRpfdf+dT\npRppdp;(23)\nwhereJsmooth exactly equals (21). To estimate Jobs(\u0000), it is required to initially\ncalculate position pi(t) (16) and velocity vi(t) for each axis at time t after\nselecting the corresponding segment ( i;i= 1;:::;md)\npi(t) =Tpi; pi= [\u00150;\u00151;:::;\u0015d]T\ni; T = [t0;t1;t2;:::;td];\nvi(t) =_pi(t) =TVpi;\npi(t) = [px(t)py(t)pz(t)]i;vi(t) = [vx(t)vy(t)vz(t)]i:(24)\nKnowing (the values of) pi(t) and vi(t),Jobs(\u0000i) can be fully determined by\nJobs(\u0000i) =Z\nSc(pi(t))ds=Ztd\nt=0c(pi(t))kvi(t)kdt=tdX\nt=0c(pi(t))kvi(t)k\u0001t\n@Jobs(\u0000i)\n@dpi(t)=tdX\nt=0kvi(t)k5ic(T(C\u00001S)pp)\u0001t+c(pi(t))vi(t)\nkvi(t)kTV(C\u00001S)pp\u0001t;\nwhere (C\u00001S)ppis the right-side matrix which corresponds to dp. For representing the collision cost c(pi(t)), a line integral of a potential function, i.e., (44),\nwas used. As total cost is given (21), Jobs(\u0000) can be calculated for all the\nsegments provided that d\u0003\npcan be estimated. In a cluttered environment, optimization problem is most likely to be non-linear as well as non-convex. Thus, 235\nBroyden|Fletcher|Goldfarb|Shanno (BFGS) [83] was used to solve the optimization problem. Yet the solver failed to obtain the global minimum most\nof the time. Hence, several random restarts were needed to \fnd the optimal\nsolution. A thorough discussion of how random restarts were invoked into the\noptimization problem was detailed in [59]. 240\n4.6. Covariant Gradients for Trajectory Generation\nThe signi\fcance of covariant gradients technique is that both Jobs(\u0000) and\nJsmooth (\u0000) depend solely on physical characteristic of the desired trajectory. In\nother words, the trajectory generation is invariant to its parameterization. If\ngradient descent is applied, it depends on the way trajectory is parameterized.\nThe covariant gradients technique removes this dependency. Hence, covariant\ngradient technique depends solely on physical representation or dynamic quantities of the trajectory with respect to an operator, \u0002.\nk\u0000k2\n\u0002=ZkX\nn=1\u0018(\u0000(t)(n))2dt; (26)\nwhere\u0018is a constant and apices(n)determine the nth order derivative. The\ncorrelation of derivatives between two trajectories: \u0000 1and \u0000 2, is de\fned by\nassuming inner product as given (27).\n<\u00001;\u00002>=ZkX\nn=1\u0018\u00001(t)(n)\u00002(t)(n)dt: (27)\nThe primary objective of \u0002 is to distinguish the norm (26) and the inner prod245\nuct (27) from the L2 norm [63].\n4.7. B-spline based Trajectory Generation\ndthorder B-spline can be de\fned for a given knot sequence pk=ft0;t1;:::;tnkg\nand control points pc=fp0;p1;:::;pnpg, wheret\u00032R,p\u00032Rdandnk=\nnp+d+ 1. If d is set to 3, each pirepresents position in R3, wherei= 0;:::;np.\nFor a given time index t, the corresponding position p(t) can be fully determined\nby using De-Boor-Cox formula [84].\np(t) =DeBoorCox (t;pc): (28)\nEstimation is not limited to the position; velocity, acceleration or any high\norder derivative of pccan be estimated using DeBoorCox (t;p(\u0003)\nc) as given in\nAlgorithm. 1, where(\u0003)depicts the order of the derivative of pcsuch that (\u0003)<d. 250\nLater, the B-spline matrix representation was proposed by Qin [85]. B-spline\ncan be formulated as uniform or non-uniform. J. Hu et al. [86] detailed the\nuniform B-spline matrix representation. In uniform B-spline, knot span is the\nsame for any considered consecutive time interval, i.e., \u0001 t=ti+1\u0000ti; i2[0;nk).\nAny position of the trajectory can be parameterized by considering only d+1\nconsecutive control points: [ pi;pi+1;:::;pi+d]. Hence, corresponding normalized\ntimeq(t) can be calculated as follows:\nq(t) =t\u0000ti\nti+1\u0000ti=t\u0000ti\n\u0001t; t2[ti;ti+1]: (29)\nIn the matrix representation, c(q(t)), which is given in (28), can be determined\nAlgorithm 1 The B-spline trajectory (p) and its derivative estimation for a\ngiven time index t, where p equals p(\u0003)\nc\n1:procedure DeBoorCox (t;p)\n2:t=8\n>>><\n>>>:pk[d]; if t<p k[d]\npk[nk]; if t>p k[nk]\nt; otherwise\n3: k = d\n4: whiletruedo\n5: ifpk[k+ 1]\u0015tthen\n6: break\n7: k++\n8: pe[d]\n9: fori 0to d do\n10: pe[i] p[k\u0000d+i]\n11: forr 1to d do\n12: fori d to r do\n13: \f t\u0000pk[i+k\u0000d]\npk[i+1+k\u0000r]\u0000pk[i+k\u0000d]\n14: pe[i] (1\u0000\f)\u0002pe[i\u00001] +\f\u0002pe[i]\n15: return pe[d]\nby:\nc(q(t)) =q(t)Mdpi;q(t) = [1;q(t);q2(t);:::;qd(t)]T; pi= [pi;pi+1;:::;pi+d]T;\nMd2Rd+1\u0002d+1; Mr;c=1\nd!\u0012d\nd\u0000r\u0013\n\u0006d\ns=c(\u00001)s\u0000c\u0002\u0012d\ns\u0000c\u0013\n(d\u0000s)d+1\u0000r\u0000s:\nSince each control point pibelongs to d+ 1 of successive spans, B-spline can\nbe controlled locally. Due to such controllability, b-spline is suitable for local\ntrajectory planning [26]. Moreover, the derivatives of a given B-spline are also\nB-spline [11]. Hence, B-spline's derivatives (e.g., velocity, acceleration, jerk)\ncan be calculated considering corresponding span [ ti;ti+ 1) for a given d+1\nconsecutive control points pi= [pi;pi+1;:::;pi+d]T2Rd\u00023and corresponding\nknot vector.\ndc(q(t))\ndu=1\n(\u0001t)b1MdviT; b 1= [0;1;u;:::;ud\u00001]2Rd+1;\nd2c(q(t))\nd2u=1\n(\u0001t2)b2MdviT; b 2= [0;0;1;u;:::;ud\u00002]2Rd+1:(31)\nThe explicit form of estimation of velocity and acceleration of a given time index\nis calculated as follows:\ndc(q(t))\ndu=d\u0001pc(i+ 1)\u0000pc(i)\npk(i+d+ 1)\u0000pk(i+ 1);\nd2c(q(t))\nd2u=\n(d2\u0000d)\u0001(pc(i+ 2)\u0000pc(i+ 1)\npk(i+d+ 2)\u0000pk(i+ 2)\u0000pc(i+ 1)\u0000pc(i)\npk(i+d+ 1)\u0000pk(i+ 1)):(32)\nIn most of the situations, initial control points are generated as explained in\nsection 3. Such methods may or may be not smooth enough for initial trajectory generation. There are various ways to generate intermediate waypoints to\nimprove the quality of the trajectory using B-splines. For example, the initial\ntrajectory was constructed using cubic B-Spline in [71]. Such a capability is 255\nmainly due to B-spline's properties.\nIt is particularly continuity and convex-hall properties that make B-spline\ntrajectory generation such a robust technique.\nFigure 5: Showing the B-spline convex-hull property. Convex hull, which comprises consecutive control points, e.g., pi;pi+1 ;pi+2andpi+3, always belongs to obstacle-free space if the\npreceding control points satisfy the inequality (33)\n4.7.1. Convex Hull Property\nAmong the properties of the B-spline, the convex hull property is the most\nsigni\fcant property due to its capabilities for checking the dynamical feasibility and the collision. How convex hull property is incorporated for calculating dynamical feasibility is given in (32). As shown in Fig. 5, dh>0 and\ndh>dc\u0000rhshould be held for a considered point in the trajectory to ensure a\ncollision-free trajectory, where dcis the distance between a given control point\nand its closest obstacle position. In dth order B-spline, a convex hull is formed\nby connecting any successive d+ 1 control points, e.g., pi;pi+1;pi+2;:::;pi+d\nor union of all consecutive control points that lie on the corresponding b-spline\ncurve [78]. Moreover, rhcan be substituted with di;i+1+di+1;i+2+di+2;i+3since\nrh\u0014di;i+1+di+1;i+2+di+2;i+3,dh>dc\u0000(di;i+1+di+1;i+2+di+2;i+3), where\ndi;i+1=kpi+1\u0000pik,di+1;i+2=kpi+2\u0000pi+1kanddi+2;i+3=kpi+4\u0000pi+3k.\nAs mentioned in [21], the following condition should hold for collision-free tra24\njectory planning:\ndi;i+1<dc\n3; dc>0; i2f1;2;3g: (33)\n4.7.2. Continuity 260\nB-spline-based trajectory generation has several advantages over the piecewise-based trajectory generation [51, 53]. The boundary constraints are to be\nsatis\fed explicitly to guarantee the continuity of a piece-wise trajectory. In\nsuch a trajectory, the smoothness of the trajectory solely depends on the way\ncontrol points are formed. On the other hand, boundary constraints can be 265\nneglected since the whole trajectory can be treated as one segment in B-splinebased trajectory generation. Moreover, the B-spline-based trajectory can be\ncontrolled locally, as explained in section 4.7.1, without a\u000becting the rest of the\ntrajectory.\nFigure 6: Trajectory generation using uniform B-spline. The smoothness of the curve is\ndependent on the degree of the B-spline. The trajectory passes precisely through the given\ncontrol points at the degree equal to 1, as depicted in light blue color. The smoothness of the\ntrajectory increases with the order of the B-spline\n4.8. Bernstein Piecewise Trajectory Generation 270\nBernstein polynomial is a speci\fc form of B-spline, which is similar to the\nBezier curve [87, 88]. Bernstein polynomial can be described as follows:\n\u0000j(t) =\u00150\njp0\nd(t) +\u00151\njp1\nd(t) +:::+\u0015d\nd(t) = \u0006d\ni=0\u0015i\nd(t);\npi\nd(t) =\u0012d\ni\u0013\n\u0001ti\u0001(1\u0000t)d\u0000i;(34)\nwheredis the degree of the polynomial, \u00150\nj;\u00151\nj;:::;\u0015d\njth polynomial segment and t2[0;1]. Since Bezier is a particular form of Bspline curve, such curves hold convex hull property. Hence, given a sequence of\ncontrol points, a constrained convex hull can be de\fned using the control points\nthat are considered. Both the beginning and end of the curve are determined\nby the \frst and the last control points, respectively. Further, the derivative of\nBezier is also a Bezier curve.\n\u0000\u0016(t) =8\n>>>>>><\n>>>>>>:s1\u0001\u0006d\ni=0\u0015i\n1;\u0016pi\nd(t\u0000t0\ns1)t0\u0014t<t 1\ns2\u0001\u0006d\ni=0\u0015i\n2;\u0016pi\nd(t\u0000t1\ns2)t1\u0014t<t 2\nsm\u0001\u0006d\ni=0\u0015i\nmd;\u0016pi\nd(t\u0000tmd\u00001\nsmd)tmd\u00001\u0014t<tmd; (35)\nwhere i, j refer to ithcontrol point in jthsegment, i.e., \u0015i\nj,sjis a scaling factor of\njthsegment for mapping time duration from [0 ;1] to [tj\u00001; tj] and\u00162fx;y;zg.\nOnce \u0000\u0016(t) is obtained, the objective is to minimize the total cost, which can\nbe determined by taking the integral of square error up to krorder as given\nin (15). Such a problem can be formulated as a QP constraint problem. For 275\ninstance, Gao and Wu [14] proposed a Bernstein-based trajectory optimization\napproach in which three types of constraints piecewise trajectory continuity,\nsafety constraints which are based on convex hull property, and dynamical feasibility constraints enforced [14].\n4.9. Comparison of several trajectory techniques 280\nIn the preceding subsections, several types of trajectory parameterization\ntechniques were considered. We have selected three di\u000berent types of trajectory parameterization techniques for this comparison: piecewise-polynomials\ntechnique, \ftting based on a sequence of points, and the third is uniform Bspline-based technique. The objective of piecewise-polynomials is to \fnd optimal polynomial coe\u000ecients [3] or end-derivatives [51] of consecutive segments,\nwhereas the objective of the third technique is to \fnd a set of points satisfying\nthe provided constraints [27]. A comparison of how velocity, acceleration, jerk,\nand snap are varied for selected techniques in terms of mean, standard deviation (std), min and max for the same a set of control points and knot vector is\npresent below. Considered knot vector and control points are\npctrl= [[0:011;\u00000:0329;2:017];[1:867;3:408;1:6];[7:514;5:715;3:735];\n[8:410;0:911;1:600];[6:902;\u00005:531;4:306];[1:899;\u00006:680;3:082];\n[\u00002:302;\u00000:611;5:375]]\npknot= [0:0;5:0;12:0;18:0;26:0;31:0;40](36)\nEach approach has its own set of parameters to \fne-tune for obtaining an optimal trajectory. The generated trajectories are shown in Fig. 6 with di\u000berent\ncon\fguration setup (with di\u000berent parameter set). Fig. 7 shows how the derivatives up to the 4th change over time on each direction, i.e.,x,y,z, separately for\neach technique. When looking at the derivatives of each method, it is clear that 285\nsmoothness, which is the main point to be considered for motion planning, is\nhigher in both B-spline and Minimum-snap compared to CHOMP. Since uniform B-spline is used in this comparison, smoothness changes of each derivative\nbetween B-spline and Minimum-snap can not be compared directly due to time\nallocation when generating the trajectories. Hence, Minimum-snap trajectory 290\nsmoothness can be changed, optimizing the time allocation process [51]. On the\ncontrary, such a time allocation process is not necessary for uniform B-spline.\nYet control points are interpolated appropriately to generate a continuous and\nsmooth trajectory.\nWe varied the parameter set of each approach appropriately and estimated 295\nmean, std, max, min of velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap pro\fle; the result\nis given in Table. 1. The results clearly indicate that the consistency of the\ntrajectory depends on the parameters that are used to parameterize the trajec27\ntory. Hence, appropriate parameter set selection for a given task is of utmost\nimportance, which can be seen by looking at the statistical properties (mean, 300\nstd, min, and max) of higher-order derivatives, e.g., velocity, acceleration, jerk,\nand snap. As described in the previous paragraph, the time allocation process\ndirectly a\u000bects the parameter selection of Minimum-snap. Further, the optimal\npolynomial coe\u000ecients process depends on time allocation as given in (13). On\nthe other hand, Poly-traj [51] generation process has fewer parameters to be 305\noptimized since it uses free end-derivatives of each segment. Hence, the latter\ntechnique is faster than Minimum-snap.\nFigure 7: Changes of position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap pro\fles over time for the\nprovided control points sequence and knot vector (36)\n5. Free Space Extraction\nObstacle region identi\fcation is of utmost essential for optimal trajectory\nplanning in real-time. In a cluttered environment, the way the trajectory plan310\nning problem formulated is matters for fast reaction. Such trajectory planning\napproaches can be designed as QP mainly due to less computation power re28\nFigure 8: Generated trajectories using three di\u000berent approaches for a given sequence of\ncontrol points and knot vector (36)\nquired for such tasks. Hence, forming obstacles-free regions in the form of convex\nhas more advantages in terms of reducing the computation power, simplicity and\nfast convergence. Chen [13] attempted to de\fne free space as a series of cubes 315\nbetween the start and goal pose. Thenceforth, OctoMap [89] was used for constructing the map surrounding the quadrotor, where regions with no obstacles\nare considered free spaces. After obtaining the free space information, obstacle\nconstraints are enforced into (15) to generate optimal trajectory.\nLetC= [cm\n1;cm\n2;:::] be a set of consecutive grids within the OctoMap and\ncorresponding free space regions be Cfree= [cf\n1;cf\n2;:::].

Similar to 325\nthe preceding approach, Gao and Shen [15] proposed a sequence of spheres to\nrepresent free space from the initial position to the \fnal position. To construct\nthe environment, a map was not built; instead, they bypassed map building\nby constructing a KD-tree [12] based placeholder to store raw point cloud for\nthe LiDAR. Afterwards, a relative map to the current pose of the MAV was 330\nretrieved using nearest neighbour search; RRG [90] combined with A* was used\nto \fnd a \right corridor or intermediate waypoints. Such intermediate waypoints\nwere connected by overlapping spheres.\nIRIS [7] is one of the \frst successful ideas in which obstacle-free spaces are\nextracted using a convex optimization technique. In this proposed approach, 335\ninitially, it is required to provide a seeking point and an area with a boundary\nbox where an obstacle-free region is to be searched. Seeking point is de\fned as\na unit ball: \"(C;p0) =fp=C~p+p0jk~pk2\u00141g, where p0is the center point.\nThe linear constraints, which separate the boundary box into obstacle-free and\nobstacle-rich regions, are de\fned as a set of hyper-planes: P=fpjAp\u0014bg. 340\nSubsequently, \fnding the optimal representation of \"(C;p0) andPwith respect\nto given obstacles, {j;j= 1;:::;N is solved as an iterative process (38).\nC;p0;A;b\u0000log(detC )\ns.t.AT\njpk\u0015bj8pk2{j; j = 1;:::;N\nk~pkAT\ni(C~p+p0)\u0014bi8i= 1;:::;N;(38)\nwhereAiandbicorrespond to ith row of A and b. The \frst constraint, i.e.,\nAT\njpk\u0015bj, is imposed to move the obstacle into one side of the plane, AT\njp=\nbj, whereas the second constraint, i.e., sup\nk~pkAT\ni(C~p+p0)\u0014bi, ensures the\nellipsoid lies on the other side of the plane. The researchers proposed to solve\nthe (38) as a two-step process: searching, \frst, for proper constraints (i.e.,\nAiandbi) and then the maximum volume that satis\fes ellipsoid, ensuring\npreceding constraints. In other words, they attempted to \fnd hyperplanes that\nseparate obstacle regions and free regions. Conceptually, hyperplane separation\nis done by \fnding planes that intersect with obstacle boundaries. Afterwards,\nthe ellipsoid is uniformly expanded until it intersects with obstacle boundaries.\nLet\u000bbe the scaling factor which de\fnes the expansion.

[17] proposed a new, quite di\u000berent from the aforesaid IRIS, ap345\nproach for extracting obstacle-free regions as a convex set SFC. SFC searches a\nset of overlapping polyhedra from the start pose to the goal pose. To get intermediate obstacle-free positions, the researchers utilized a graph search technique,\nnamely JPS [67]. The main reason for selecting JPS over sampling-based algorithms (e.g., RRT* and PRM) or search-based techniques such as A* or Dijkstra 350\nis due to the nature of JPS; it uses uniform-cost grid map with uniform voxels.\nIn general, sampling-based techniques are not deterministic though probabilistically complete. Thus, there is no guarantee about the duration of searching\ntime. On the other hand, the computational time for search-based methods is\npretty high if the environment is cluttered. However, JPS has a lower searching 355\ntime compared to A* [17]. Let pc=p0;p1;:::;pnbe the intermediate waypoints from start to goal pose and li=<pi;pi+1>be theithline segment,\nwherei= 1;:::;n\u00001. Each line segment constitutes convex polyhedra, namely,\nEi. Along with that, SFC can be expressed as SFC (P) =fEiji= 0;:::;n\u00001g.\nSFC has two steps: \fnding Eithat \fts the liand seeking a set of linear inequal360\nities that are tangent to Ei.

Afterwards, semi-axes except for the axis along\npi+1\u0000pi, are shrunk until the corresponding ellipsoid contains no obstacles.

The same approach is applied to each line segment,\nliin which we can generate each Ci. All in all, SFC (P) =fCji= 0;:::;n\u00001g\ncan be constructed. A more descriptive formulation is in [17, Algorithm 1]. 370\n6. Continuous Trajectory Re\fnement\nThe objective function consists of several sub-objective functions: for improving the smoothness, for avoiding obstacles and so forth. In this section,\na precise explanation is given on how to construct sub-objective functions for\neach of the various occasions. First, we examine the simplest case where only\ndynamic feasibility and obstacle avoidance constraints are taken into consideration. LetJbe the objective function or performance index\nJ(\u0000) =\u0018smoothJsmooth (\u0000) +\u0018obsJobs(\u0000): (41)\nThere are various formulations of how JobsandJsmooth are determined. In\ngeneral,Jsmooth can be expressed as:\nJsmooth (\u0000) =1\n2Z1\n0\r\r\r\rd\u0000(t)\ndt\r\r\r\r2\ndt: (42)\nEliminating unnecessary higher-order motion is the main objective of the Jsmooth .\nOn the other hand, Jobsencourages to generate or modify collision-free trajectory by trying to push control points away from the obstacle zone if the trajectory is already in collisions or penalizing parts of the trajectory that is close\nto the obstacles. Let B\u001aRdbe the exterior boundary of the MAV and cis\nthe cost function of penalizing close-in obstacles with respect to B. Along with\nthat,Jobscan be formulated as follows:\nJobs(\u0000) =Z1\n0Z\nu2Bc(fc(\u0000(t);p))\r\r\r\rdfc(\u0000(t);p)\ndt\r\r\r\r2\ndpdt; (43)\nwhere the function fc(\u0000(t);p), which was proposed by Ratli\u000b at al. [27], can be\nde\fned as follows:\nfc(\u0000(t);p) =8\n>>><\n>>>:\u0000dis(\u0000(t);p) +1\n2\u000edisif dis (\u0000(t);p)<0\n2\u000edis(dis(\u0000(t);p)\u0000\u000edis)2if0<dis (\u0000(t);p)\u0014\u000edis\n0 otherwise;(44)\nwhere\u000edisdenotes the distance from the boundary (B) of the quadrotor to a\ngiven obstacle position. Before taking gradient at i, J(\u0000) is linearized around i,\nJ(\u0000)\u0019J(\u0000i)+(\u0000\u0000\u0000i)T5J(\u0000i). De\fning c and d is detailed in [27, eqs.(22-28)].\nIn [21], the cost of the trajectory was estimated based on the following\nformulation:\nJ(\u0000) =\u0018obsJobs(\u0000)+\u0018smoothJsmooth (\u0000)+\u0018softJsoft(\u0000); Jsoft(\u0000) =Jv(\u0000)+Ja(\u0000);\nwhereJsoft(\u0000) is determined by soft limits on acceleration and velocity. Jsmooth (\u0000)\nis de\fned by considering only geometric information without minimizing snap\nand/or jerk [3]. Such minimization is required because of the following stages of\ntrajectory optimization. In such trajectory optimization, time reallocation has\nless impact on the objective function. Hence, Jsmooth (\u0000) is de\fned as follows:\nJsmooth (\u0000) = \u0006n+1\u0000d\ni=d\u00001\r\r\r\r\r\r\rpi+1\u0000pi|{z}\nfi+1;i+pi\u00001\u0000pi|{z}\nfi\u00001;i\r\r\r\r\r\r\r2\n; (46)\nwhere a number of control points, denoted n, and fi+1;iandfi\u00001;ican be in375\nterpreted as connecting joint force of two springs between control points pairs:\n(pi+1;pi) and ( pi\u00001;pi), for example, control points lie on a straight line if\nthe sum of all terms equals zero. As aside, similar approaches were proposed\nin [91, 92].\nThe value of Jobs(\u0000) is determined by calculating the distance to the closest\nobject pose from each control point in which the distance to the obstacle, i.e.,\nfc(pi), is given by\nfc(pi) =8\n<\n:(dis(pi)\u0000\u000e)2dis(pi)\u0014\u000edis\n0dis(pi)>\u000edis; (47)\nwhere\u000edisis the free distance between MAV's center and the pose of the closest obstacle. Hence, Jobs(\u0000) = \u0006n\ni=dfc(pi) can be estimated based on a given\ntrajectory in the form of control points. Soft constraints are de\fned by not\nexceeding both acceleration and velocity within those max limits.\nJv(\u0000) =X\n\u0016n\u0000dX\ni=d\u00001fv(vi;\u0016); Ja(\u0000) =X\n\u0016kd\u0000dX\ni=d\u00002fa(ai;\u0016)\nf(v) =8\n<\n:(v2\n\u0016\u0000v2\nmax)2v2\n\u0016>v2\n0 v2\n\u0016\u0014v2\nmax; f(a) =8\n<\n:(a2\n\u0016\u0000a2\nmax)2a2\n\u0016>a2\n0 a2\n\u0016\u0014a2\nmax;\nTo calculate acceleration and velocity at each control point and when both acceleration and velocity exceed their maximum limits, convex hull property (33)\nof b-spline is utilized to penalize those control points. Based on the previous\nmethod, [26] proposed an endpoint cost Jendpoint (\u0000), into the objective function\nas an additional term. The key intuition behind adding Jendpoint (\u0000) is to reduce the error between local trajectory and global trajectory since Jendpoint (\u0000)\npenalizes error of both velocity and position with respect to the desired global\ntrajectory. Jendpoint (\u0000) is determined as follows:\nJendpoint (\u0000) =Jend(\u0000) =\u0018p\nend(p(tend)\u0000pend)2+\u0018v\nend(_p(tend)\u0000_pend)2;(49)\nwhere\u0018p\nendand\u0018v\nendare regularization parameters, whereas pendand _pendare 380\ndesired end position and velocity of the trajectory.\n7. Receding Horizon Trajectory Planning\nOn most occasions, paths which are obtained by planning techniques are suboptimal. Hence, the initial trajectory that is generated based on the initial path\nis to be re\fned, ensuring dynamic feasibility for controlling the MAV. Various 385\napproaches can be applied for trajectory re\fnement. However, enabling recursive feasibility, incorporating terminal constraints and convergence to the desired\nstate are the utmost importance considerations to be contemplated throughout\nthe process. LQR and MPC are the two most popular approaches that are\nbeing used for receding horizon planning. LQR is applied for linear systems, 390\nwhereas iLQR and DDP are applied for non-linear system. Both in LQR or\niLQR, OCP is de\fned as an open-loop control problem. On the other hand,\nMPC is designed as a close-loop OCP. In other words, OCP is seeking actions\nknowing the behaviour of the surrounding environment.\n7.1. LQR based trajectory generation 395\nDDP [93, 94] is one of the \frst techniques proposed for solving optimal\ncontrol problems. Let xk+1=fd(xk;uk) be the discrete-time system dynamics;\nthe total cost of the trajectory can be formulated for a given control policy, i.e.,\n\u0019k+i, for alli=f0;1;:::;N\u00001g.\nN\u00001X\ni=0c(xk+i;uk+i) +cgoal(xk+N): (50)\nThe optimal control input, i.e., uk+i=\u0019k+i(xk+i), for a given time index, i.e.,\ni+k, can be obtained by minimizing the (50). Thus, cost (cost-to-go) which was\nproposed in [95] is fully determined by\nVk+i(xk+i) = min\nuk+i(c(xk+i;uk+i) +Vk+1(fd(xk+i;uk+i)): (51)\nThe same procedure can be applied recursively in a backward direction for seeking the optimal \u0019k+i(xk+i) = arg minuk+i(c(xk+i;uk+i)+Vk+i(fd(xk+i;uk+i))).\nDDP yields almost the same behaviour: \frst estimate optimal control and then\napply a forward pass to determine the updated nominal trajectory. Consequently, LQR is a simpli\fed version of DDP. LQR is one of the fundamental\nways to obtain a closed-form solution for a given optimal control problem under which system dynamics is assumed to be linear. Let us assume the system\ndynamics is de\fned as in (4). The intuition of LQR is to estimate the optimal\ncontrol sequence for maneuvering the quadrotor from an initial position to the\ndesired pose. Let N be the receding horizon whose optimal trajectory is to be\ndetermined. The total cost, i.e., Jk(xk;\u0019N), consists of three parts: initial,\nintermediate and \fnal costs, where \u0019N=f\u0019k;\u0019k+1;:::;\u0019k+i;:::;\u0019N\u00001g\nJk(xk;\u0019N) =cstart(xk) +N\u00001X\ni=0c(xk+i;uk+i)dt+cend(xk+N); (52)\nwhere@2Cstart(xk)\n@x@x\u00140;@2Cgoal(xk+N)\n@x@x\u00140;@2C\n@2\n664x\nu3\n775@2\n664x\nu3\n775\u00140, and@2C\n@u@u\u00140\nare positive semide\fnite Hessians to guarantee the minimizing of the total cost.\nThe total cost can be formulated in various ways. In LQR, the total cost is\nde\fned as Quadratic costs as follows:\ncstart(xk) =1\n2xT\nkQstartxk+xT\nkqstart;\ncgoal(xk+N) =1\n2xT\nk+NQgoalxk+N+xT\nk+Nqgoal;\nc(xk+i;uk+i) =1\n2xT\nk+iQxk+i+1\n2uT\nk+iRuk+i+uT\nk+iPxk+i+xT\nk+ip\n+uT\nk+ir+\u0018=1\n4xk+i\nuk+i3\n5T2\n4Q PT\nP R3\n|{z}\nJk2\n4xk+1\nuk+13\nk+i+2\n4xk+1\nuk+13\n4p\nr3\n|{z}\njk+\u0018;(53)\nwherei2f0;1;:::;N\u00001g,Qstart2Rnx\u0002nx;Qgoal2Rnx\u0002nx;Q2Rnx\u0002nx;R2\nRnu\u0002nu;P2Rnu\u0002nx;qstart2Rnx;qgoal2Rnx;p2Rnx,r2Rnu, and\u00182Rare\nprede\fned in which Qstart;Qgoal;Q, andRare positive de\fnite, whereas Jk\u00150\nandjk\u00150 assumed to be positive semi-de\fnite. LQR problem( 52) and (53)\nprovides an optimal \u0019Nin close form solution as expressed in 51; the cost-to-go\nfunction, i.e., 51, can be reformulated as an explicit quadratic formulation as\nfollows:\nVk+i(xk+i) =1\n4xk+i\nuk+i3\n5T\nJk+i2\n4xk+i\nuk+i3\n5+2\n4xk+i\nuk+i3\n5T\njk+i+\u0018: (54)\nEstimation of both Jk+iandjk+ican be obtained in a recursive way starting\nfrom the goal position xx+Nto the initial position xk, using Riccati di\u000berential\nequation for all i=f0;:::;N\u00001g.\nJk=Q+AT\nkJk+1Ak\u0000\n(P+BT\nkJk+1Ak)T\u0001(R+BT\nkJk+1Bk)\u00001\u0001(P+BT\nkJk+1Ak)\njk=p+AT\nkjk+1+AT\nkJk+1ck\n\u0000(P+BT\nkJk+1Ak)T\u0001(R+BT\nkJk+1Bk)\u00001\nk\u0001(r+BT\nkjk+1+BT\nkJk+1ck):(55)\nIn general, system dynamics is described by:\nxk+1=fd(xk;uk) =Akxk+Bkuk; (56)\n.

The feedback control policy in LQR is fully determined as follows:\n\u0019k(xk) =\u0000(R+BT\nkJk+1Bk)\u00001\u0001(P+BT\nkJk+1At)xk\n\u0000(R+BT\nkJk+1Bk)\u00001\u0001(r+BT\nkjk+1+BT\nkJk+1Bk):(58)\nAs given in (55), system stability depends on system dynamics. When\nquadrotor dynamics is non-linear, the stability of iLQR is not guaranteed. Jur\nand Berg [29] attempted to address the stability issue by proposing a novel\nmethod called LQR smoothing; this method can be applied for linear or nonlinear systems to acquire the minimum-cost trajectory. The main di\u000berence 400\nin LQR smoothing compared to LQR is that LQR minimizes the cost of not\nonly backward direction, i.e., cost-to-go, but also applies forward direction, i.e.,\ncost-to-come [29, 6, 96]. However, the output of LQR, iLQR or LQR smoothing\ndoes not address the system noise. Both linear or nonlinear state estimator\nmay eliminate the system noise. LQG [30, 97] is one of the ways to solve this 405\nproblem. LQG consists of a state estimator ,i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), and state\nfeedback, i.e., iLQR or LQR.\n7.2. MPC based trajectory generation\nFigure 10: The basic idea of MPC-based receding horizon planning\nAs detailed in section 7.1, unaccountability of addressing sudden disturbances is the main limitation of OCP techniques (e.g., LQR, DDP); this is due 410\nto its nature. LQR calculates \fxed receding control policy and applies to the\nsystem; there is no intervention during the control policy execution. MPC is\none of the ways to address the preceding problem, which is characteristic of\nboth LQR and DDP. The di\u000berence between MPC and LQR is that only the\nrst portion of the control policy is applied to system in MPC through the cal415\nculate of full control policy rather than employing full control policy as in LQR.\nLet us assume the system dynamics as given in (2). In general, MPC can be\nformed as follows:\nwJend(xk+N;xref\nk+N) +Jk(x;u;xref;uref)\ns.t.xk+1=fd(xk;uk)\nxmin\u0014xk+i\u0014xmax80\u0014i\u0014N\numin\u0014uk+i\u0014umax80\u0014i<N\u00001\ng1(w) = 0\ng2(w)\u00140;(59)\nwherew=uk;:::;uk+N\u00001is the optimal control sequence to be estimated in\neach iteration. Variable Jend(xk+N) plays a signi\fcant role in terms of the stability of the system locally and globally. Presenting local stability is relatively easy,\ne.g., Lyapunov's analysis compared to global stability. In addition to terminal\ncost, terminal constraints for states should be enforced, which is quite computationally challenging for real-time applications. Moreover, enforcing terminal\nconstraints is even more di\u000ecult for non-linear dynamics. Thus, in most of the\npractical applications, terminal constraints are not enforced into the optimization procedure. Furthermore, classical MPC lacks recursive feasibility. Several\nvarieties of MPC have been proposed to address processing issues to a certain\nextent. For a linear system, the performance index, i.e., Jk(x;u;zref;uref), can\nbe de\fned as follows:\nJk(x;u;zref;uref)\n=N\u00001X\ni=0((xk+i\u0000xref\nk+i)TQx(xk+i\u0000xref\nk+i) + (uk+i\u0000uref\nk+i)TRu(uk+i\u0000uref\nk+i))\n+(xk+N\u0000xref\nk+N)TP(xk+N\u0000xref\nk+N);\nwhereQx, which is a positive semi-de\fnite matrix, consists of the state error\npenalty coe\u000ecients, whereas Rushould be positive de\fnite and P is state error 420\non the terminal cost. In principle, stability and feasibility are not assured implicitly. Consequently, stability and feasibility tend to improve for the longer\nreceding horizon, which is quite challenging due to computational demands.\nQuadrotor dynamics are usually expressed in a non-linear fashion. Therefore\nLQR or linear MPC can not be applied without linear approximation. Hence, 425\nNonlinear Programming (NLP)-based approach has to be applied. Direct multiple shooting and direct collocation are the main two techniques that are used\nto transform OCP into NLP. In both direct multiple shooting and direct collocation, the state is minimized in addition to controlling inputs. Direct multiple\nshooting di\u000bers from direct collocation due to the way of the problem formu430\nlation. In multiple shooting, the problem is quantized into N subintervals, i.e.,\nreceding horizon length. In direct collocation, however, those subintervals are\nfurther described by a set of polynomials such as B-spline or Lagrangian; this\nwill increase the problem sparsity. On the contrary, the number of optimization parameters to be optimized has dramatically increased in direct collocation 435\ncompared to multiple shooting. This, collocation is better when it is accuracywise, but direct multiple shooting is better when it is performance-wise. In [71],\nthe trajectory tracking problem is formulated based on direct collocation and\nmultiple shooting. Further, the researchers have proved that multiple shooting\nhas a lower computational footprint compared to direct collocation. 440\n7.3. Disturbance Estimation\nIn the context of optimal trajectory planning, simultaneously computing\noptimal control policy, which is required to respond to unknown, sudden disturbances, and handling kinematics (i.e., obstacle avoidance) as well as dynamics (i.e., satisfying velocity and acceleration constraints) yields a challenging 445\nproblem, especially for quadrotors. While geometry-based path planning techniques [98, 99] ensure the asymptotical optimality of a path, they however do\nnot consider quadrotor dynamics. But, it is essential that the generation of\nan optimal control policy ensures dynamic feasibility. So, in [100, 101], LQR\nwas incorporated into path planning, by which both dynamic feasibility and lo450\ncal optimality were guaranteed. However, local optimality does not necessarily\nyield global optimality [102]. In [17, 14], a set of motion primitives was used to\nnd feasible trajectories ensuring both global and local optimality. When dealing with unknown disturbances, MPC is a more robust technique than LQR. In\nlocal and global optimality. However, none of the aforesaid approaches formally\nguarantees stability and safety. Lyapunov's analysis can be applied to con\frm\nthe local stability. Moreover, the terminal constraints set [103] can be incorporated. However, those measures are time-consuming, which directly a\u000bects\nthe real-time performance [104]. A set of CBFs was proposed for improving 460\nreal-time performance without a\u000becting the system stability in [105, 106, 33].\nRecently, reference governors-based techniques were proposed in [107, 108], enforcing safety constraints. It is natural that designing a path planer is followed\nby the actual controller to maneuver MAV. In such approaches, a reference governor can be used to handle the stability and constraint satisfaction separately 465\nto ensure system stability [109].\nThe above approaches are employed to estimate optimal control policy for\nsafe navigation while imposing stability either using Lyapunov functions or reference governors. On the other hand, Li et al. [110] proposed to obtain an\noptimal control policy using a State-dependant Distance Metric (SDDM). They\nhave modelled the system dynamics as a linear, time-invariant as follows:\n_x=Ax+Bu; (61)\nwhere uindicates the control input. System state, i.e., x:= (p(t);y(t)), consists\nof two parts: pandy, where p(t) denotes the quadrotor position at a given\ntime t and y(t) describes the higher-order terms, e.g., velocity, acceleration,\netc. In the latter work, the quadratic norm was utilized to represent the error 470\nbetween robot position and close-in obstacles positions. The quadratic norm is\nde\fned askpkR:=p\npTRp, where R is a symmetric positive matrix. R[ z] is\nfully determined by the MAV heading direction zat a given time instance as\nfollows:\nR[ z] =8\n<\n:c2I+ (c1\u0000c2) z T\nz\nk zk2; if z6= 0\nc1I; otherwise; (62)\nwhere both c1andc2are prede\fned scales such that c2>c1>0; this process is 475\ncalled the SDDM, trajectory will be bounded incorporating SDDM information.\nSince quadrotor dynamics is linear, a reference governor [108] is introduced to\nmaintain safety and stability. Other than LQR and MPC, there exist several\nreceding horizon-based techniques for optimal trajectory planning as given in\nTable 2. 480\n8. Solving Trajectory Planning Problem\nAs explained in the preceding sections, several constraints (e.g., soft and\nhard) are imposed to ensure dynamic feasibility, smooth navigation, handling\ndisturbances, etc. Hence, optimal trajectory planning is posed as a constraint\noptimization problem in most situations. Constraint-based optimization prob485\nlems are solved in two di\u000berent ways: adding hard constraints or introducing\nsoft constraints. In general, a constraint-based optimization problem can be\nformulated as a quadruple, i.e., Pconstraint = (c;g1;g2;J), where c stands for\nperformance index or cost function, whereas equality and inequality constraints\nTable 2: Comparison of properties of receding horizon trajectory planning techniques\n(DDP) [111]7 7\nRegulator (LQR) [112]7 7 7\n(iLQR) [113]7 7\nControl (MPC) [114]7 7 7\n(NMPC) [71]7\n(NMPC-CGMRES) [115]7 7\nCorridor-based Model\nControl(CMPCC) [32]7 7 7\n(NMPC-Newton) [116]7 7 7\n(MPPI) [117]7 7\n(CEM) [118]7 7\nare given by g1 and g2, respectively. The objective function is given by J. In 490\nhard constraint-based formulation, the optimal solution, i.e., w, forPconstraint\nis calculated, ensuring all the constraints. In soft constraints formulation, the\nobjective function does not need to satisfy all the constraints, but satisfying\nthose constraints will improve the \fnal w. D. Mellinger and V.Kumar [3] took\nthe lead in proposing a successful approach for trajectory generation as a hard 495\nconstraint-based optimization approach, i.e., Minimum-snap. Subsequently,\nin [51], the researchers extended the Minimum-snap trajectory generation as\nan unconstrained or soft constraint-based optimization problem.\nWhen generating trajectories, ensuring a collision-free path is essential. Hence,\nrepresenting free space in a structured way and imposing obstacle constraints 500\nfor trajectory generation is a must for safety. Free space can be represented\nin di\u000berent ways such as cubes ( [13, 14]), spheres ([15, 16]) and polyhedrons\n([17]). The intuition of these approaches is to apply path planning through the\nfree space to obtain the intermediate waypoints. Once intermediate waypoints\nare extracted, the trajectory generation procedure is utilised for retrieving a 505\nsmooth, feasible, collision-free trajectory. On the other hand, in [47, 24, 14],\nkinodynamic path planning followed by B-spline-based trajectory generation is\nconsidered. Most of the works that were proposed for soft constraint-based\ntrajectory generation formulated optimal trajectory planning as nonlinear optimization problems in which smoothness and safety were introduced as soft 510\nconstraints. Most of the time gradient-descent based [63] or gradient-free approaches [66, 53] were applied for minimizing the cost of smoothness and safety.\nThe constraints optimization problem can be designed in either QP or NLP\nform. In QP, the procedure is to minimize or maximize the objective subject to\na set of linear constraints in most situations. On the other hand, non-quadratic 515\nprogramming is used to handle the non-linear constraints each of which has a\nunique nature to solve the problem. In general, QP objective can be described\nas:\nx1\n2xTQx+cTx\ns.t.Ax\u0017b;(63)\nwhereAx\u0017bstands for the set of linear inequalities. Q is a positive symmetric matrix. There are various ways to solve QP, including interior point, 520\nactive set and gradient projection. In some situations, multiple variables that\nare to be optimized are integer values; those are solved as MIQP. For example,\nFASTER [119] used MIQP for safe trajectory planning with aggressive controls [52].\nMost of the recent optimal trajectory planning techniques [21, 26, 20, 53]\nwere formulated as GTO in which optimization problem was designed as a nonlinear form. The gradient descent is performed with respect to each parametrization index of \u0000 to minimize the di\u000berent, i.e., \u0000 i+1\u0000\u0000i. Hence, \u0000 i+1can be\ndetermined by solving the following optimization problem as given in [120, 63].\n\u0000i+1= arg min\n\u0000J(\u0000i) + (J(\u0000)\u0000J(\u0000i))T5J(\u0000i) +\u0011\n2k\u0000\u0000\u0000ik2\nM; (64)\nwhere M is a weighting matrix and \u0011is a regularization parameter. GTO 525\nis rather popular due to its ability to deform ine\u000bability trajectory segments,\nlow memory requirement and high throughput. Despite having the listed advantages, GTO can not avoid the problem of a local minimum. STOMP [66]\nis one of the early techniques proposed to address the local minimum problem. STOMP is based on the gradient-free technique. However, STOMP 530\nis unable to obtain real-time performance. Besides STOMP, the local minimum problem has been addressed by various recent works. Yet, this remains\nan open problem to be solved. Zhou [121] proposed a method, i.e., Pathguided Optimization (PGO), for overcoming local minima problem by generating topologically distinct paths and doing parallel optimization. Further535\nmore, various solvers can be utilized for solving optimization problems, including BOBYQA [122], L-BFGS [123, 11], ACADO [124], SLSQP [125], Proximal\nOperator Graph Solver (POGS) [126, 127], Sequential Quadratic Programming\n(SQP) and MMA [128]. Shravan et al. [74] proposed a trajectory optimization technique in a distributed setup in which the researchers evaluated their 540\nformulation with several solvers. According to their observations, BOBYQA\nis faster compared to BFGS and SLSQP, while MMA yielded a similar performance to that of BOBYQA. In [129], L-BFGS was proposed for \fnding the\nshortest path in real-time; in this research e\u000bort however L-BFGS does not\nguarantee optimality, only feasibility is enforced. Mathematical Program with 545\nComplementarity Constraints (MPCC) [130] yet another proposed method for\nfast trajectory optimization in real-time. Moreover, Mathieu and Nicolas [131]\nproposed a SQP-based trajectory generation approach for carrying augmented\nloads. The intuition behind selecting SQP over other solvers is due to its superlinear convergency and ability to handle non-linear constraints within millisec550\nonds.\n9. Conclusion\nAll in all, we have thoroughly reviewed the trajectory planning problem\nin the paradigm of plan-based control for MAVs. Such trajectory planning\nproblem was broken down into a set of subproblems: free-space segmentation, 555\nmotion model selection, initial waypoints identi\fcation, initial trajectory generation, continuous trajectory re\fnement, and receding horizon trajectory planning. Afterwards, for each subproblem, we examined how previous research\nhas addressed those by presenting and evaluating various approaches to the\nconsidered subproblem. Finally, several selected recent approaches were listed 560\n(Table 3) according to the listed subproblems we have identi\fed. With that, we\nconcluded that the trajectory planning problem can be designed by addressing\nthose subproblems carefully for MAVs.\n(ExactjEmpirical\nflatness (DF))Intermediate Waypoint\ntopological searchPGO based B-splines GTO ESDF -\nwith minimum-jerkElastic band optimization Convex Cluster -\nsearchEO ~QCQP TSDF -\nT-NEWTON [135]ESDF -\nSystem (VINS)Gradient-based TSDF GTC\nsearchUniform B-spline Constrained QP ESDF RHC\nReferences 565\nfor quadrotors, in: 2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and\nAutomation, IEEE, 2011, pp. 2520{2525. 570\nthrough partial di\u000berential \ratness., in: Robotics: Science and Systems,\n2014.\ngent & Robotic Systems 77 (1) (2015) 113{133.\nspace through semide\fnite programming, in: Algorithmic foundations of\nrobotics XI, Springer, 2015, pp. 109{124.\nvisual slam features, in: 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), IEEE, 2017, pp. 1374{1381. 585\non stereographic projection, in: 2017 International Siberian Conference\non Control and Communications (SIBCON), IEEE, 2017, pp. 1{6.\narXiv:2010.08744.\ntrajectory tracking approach for multi-rotor aerial vehicles in unknown\nenvironments, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters 7 (2) (2022) 4598{\n4605. 595\nsearching, Communications of the ACM 18 (9) (1975) 509{517.\night in cluttered environments, in: 2015 IEEE International Conference\non Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO), IEEE, 2015, pp. 1678{1685. 600\nquadrotors using fast marching method and bernstein basis polynomial,\nin: 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation\n(ICRA), IEEE, 2018, pp. 344{351.\nnavigation on point clouds, in: 2016 IEEE International Symposium on\nSafety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), IEEE, 2016, pp. 139{146.\nenvironments, Journal of Field Robotics 36 (4) (2019) 710{733. 610\nV.

Reid, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, USA Abstract Electropolishing (EP) of 1.3 GHz niobium superconduct-ing RF cavities is conducted to achieve a desired smooth and contaminant-free surface that yields good RF perfor-mance. Achieving a smooth surface of a large-sized ellip-tical cavity with the standard EP conditions was found to be challenging. This work aimed to conduct a systematic parametric EP study to understand the effects of various EP parameters on the surface of 650 MHz niobium cavities used in the Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) linear ac-celerator. Parameters optimized in this study provided a smooth surface of the cavities. The electropolished cavity showed a significantly higher accelerating gradient meet-ing baseline requirement and qualified for further surface treatment to improve the cavity quality factor. INTRODUCTION Electropolishing (EP) is a widely utilized technique for treating metal surfaces. It is commonly employed to pro-cess niobium made superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities [1-3], which are key components in particle accel-erators. These cavities are operated at high frequencies, typically ranging from several hundred megahertz to a few gigahertz, in order to accelerate charged particles. The pro-ton improvement plan-II (PIP-II) linear accelerator (linac), with a target energy of 800 MeV, will incorporate various types of cavities, including low-β (0.61) and high-β (0.92) 650 MHz elliptical 5-cell cavities. These cavities are known as LB650 and HB650, respectively. To meet the field gradient specification, the PIP-II ellip-tical cavities will undergo electropolishing to achieve a smooth interior surface. In a previous study, we empha-sized the significance of cathode size by comparing the sur-face morphology of LB650 cavities. The larger cathode surface area provided required conditions including current plateau for electropolishing, as determined by I-V measure-ments [4]. It was previously established that the standard voltage of 18 V was insufficient for performing elec-tropolishing of the LB650 cavities, particularly with a cath-ode surface area of approximately 5% of the cavity surface area. Increasing the cathode surface area to approximately 10% significantly reduced the EP voltage. However, it was still higher than the standard 18 V when the cavity temper-ature was 22 ºC set in bulk EP process [4]. In this study, we present a new cathode design specifi-cally designed for electropolishing the HB650 elliptical cavities. The results include cavity’s surface and SRF per-formance, which are also compared to those obtained with LB650 cavities. SETUP EP setup The EP process for the 650 MHz cavities was conducted using a horizontal EP tool located at Argonne National Lab. Figure 1 displays a photograph of the EP setup, fea-turing a horizontally assembled 650 MHz 5-cell cavity. For the standard EP procedure, a power supply with specifications of 80 V ´ 500 A was used. Throughout the EP process, the temperature of the cavity was regulated by spraying water onto the exterior surface of the cavity wall. The system utilized in this study was identical to the one used for EP of LB650 cavities. Further information about the system and data logging can be found elsewhere. [4, 5].\nFigure 1: EP tool with a 650 MHz 5-cell cavity. Cathode Structure A novel cathode with an enhanced surface area was de-veloped for EP of HB650 cavities. The surface area of HB650 cavity was 1.951 m2. Fig. 2 illustrates the design of the patented cathode [6]. There was no tape masking ap-plied to the iris and beam tube regions. Instead, a floating mask that was set over the cathode pipe in the iris and beam tube regions was used. The entire cathode surface area was exposed to the acid to maximize the surface area of the cathode. This new design improved the ratio of cathode to anode surface area to approximately 3:10. Additionally, the cathode incorporated a spacious cross-sectional opening, which might facilitate better acid conductance and mini-mize the buildup of hydrogen gas around the cathode sur-face.\n____________________________________________ * This work was supported by the United States Department of Energy, Offices of High Energy Physics and Basic Energy Sciences under con-tract No. DE-AC02-07CH11359 with Fermi Research Alliance. † vchouhan@fnal.gov\nFigure 2: Cavity with a schematic of the cathode (top). Yel-low lines show insulating cover over the cathode in iris and beam tube regions. Cathode structure used for EP of the HB650 cavity (bottom) [6]. RESULTS Polarization Curves The polarization curves were obtained using the novel cathode at various temperatures of the cavity. In this con-text, the cavity temperature refers to the average surface temperature when the current started plateauing in the cor-responding I-V curve. Figure 3 illustrates the curves ob-tained within a temperature range of 10-25 ºC. Figure 3 (b) shows the onset voltage, which represents the voltage at which the current plateau begins, as a function of the cavity temperature. The horizontal error bars represent the stand-ard deviation in the cavity temperature, while the vertical error bar indicates the maximum possible error in estimat-ing the onset voltage. It was observed that the onset voltage increased linearly with the cavity temperature. A similar trend was observed in the case of LB650 cavities using a cathode with a surface area having 10% of the cavity sur-face area. For comparison, the onset voltage versus cavity temperature curve for LB650 cavities was added in Fig. 3 (b). The novel cathode design resulted in a reduction in the onset voltage by 3 V , providing an advantage over the cath-ode used in electropolishing LB650 cavities. Surface Processing The surface of an as-received HB650 5-cell cavity (B92F-RI-203) was processed with bulk EP followed by heat treatment at 900 ºC for 3 h and light EP. EP of the cavity was performed with the novel cathode to evaluate the impact of its high surface area on the cavity surface morphology and its SRF performance. The cavity temperature during bulk and light EP was maintained at 25 ºC and 12 ºC, respectively. The details of the parameters and removal thickness are mentioned in Table 1. Current and temperature profiles during bulk and light EP are shown in Fig. 4. The EP rate was estimated to be ~0.15 and ~0.08 µm/min in bulk and light EP, respectively.\nFigure 3: (a) Polarization curves at various cavity temper-atures during EP of the HB650 cavity. (b) Onset voltage as a function of cavity temperature for the HB650 and LB650 cavities [3]. The surface after bulk removal was inspected with an optical camera to find the impact of the novel cathode and the applied conditions. An optical image of the equator sur-face in cell-1 is shown in Fig. 5. The surface was found uniform in all the cells. The surface appeared smooth, and no adverse impact of the large cathode surface area was seen on the surface. The iris and beam tube were also found smooth and pit-free. The surface smoothness was con-firmed by making replica of the equator. The replica sur-face was examined with laser confocal scanning micro-scope. The surface roughness Ra was estimated to be 0.6±0.1 µm.",

DISCUSSION The lower onset voltage observed in EP with the novel cathode can be explained by the degree of cathode polari-zation. The larger surface area reduced the current density and quantity of hydrogen gas bubbles, generated in the chemical reduction reaction, on the cathode surface. Addi-tionally, the cathode design might help in reducing the ac-cumulation of hydrogen gas bubbles, which in turn de-creases cathode screening and polarization. The lower cathode current density might result in a lower voltage drop at the cathode-electrolyte interface due to electrical re-sistance. The reduced cathode screening could also con-tribute to a lower voltage drop in the novel cathode with a larger surface area. This effect was observed when the cathode surface area was increased from 5% to 10% of the cavity surface area [4]. These results suggested that a large cathode surface is necessary for EP of large-sized cavities such as LB650 and HB650 at a lower voltage. The reduced voltage requirement for EP can decrease the power load on the cathode and potentially minimize sulfur generation during the EP process. Sulfur typically mani-fests as particles on the cathode surface. Additionally, the cathode enables EP to be conducted at temperatures above 22 ºC, which was typically used for LB650 cavities, while maintaining a voltage of 25 V to slightly enhance the EP rate in bulk EP. The EP of another HB650 5-cell cavity was successfully demonstrated at 28 ºC and 25 V , resulting in a surface as smooth as the B92F-RI-203. Moreover, the lower onset voltage in EP of nitrogen doped surface re-duces the risk of surface pitting, as discussed elsewhere [6]. With the novel cathode, it is possible to perform EP at a low temperature of 12 ºC with an applied voltage of 18 V while maintaining it 5 V higher than the onset voltage. All EP procedures were carried out with the understanding that the applied voltage should be at least 5 V higher than the onset voltage. This criterion was established and enforced due to the likelihood of the beam tube, iris, and the surface near the iris having a lower onset voltage compared to the equator region. These regions might show a greater influ-ence on the I-V curve trend than the equator surface. Con-sequently, the average I-V curve in EP might reach a plateau at a lower voltage than that required for the equator surface. An EP study conducted on a 9-cell cavity demon-strated notable differences between the average I-V curve and measurements obtained solely from isolated coupons located at the equator, as described in my paper [2]. The smooth surface was achieved as the EP was per-formed in the current plateau region in the I-V curve. The smooth cavity surface and good performance of the cavity in the vertical test validated that the large surface area of the novel cathode and applied EP parameters were within an optimum range. CONCLUSION A novel cathode, designed with a significantly larger sur-face area, was developed for the EP process of the HB650 cavity. This innovative cathode design led to a reduction in the onset voltage observed in the I-V curves. As a result, EP could be performed at a comparatively lower voltage. The open structure of the cathode also played a role in mit-igating the accumulation of hydrogen gas bubbles around the cathode, consequently reducing cathode screening. To evaluate the effectiveness of the novel cathode, cavity B92F-RI-203 underwent electropolishing using the new cathode and the associated parameters. The electropolish-ing process yielded a smooth surface, and the cavity exhib-ited excellent SRF performance. Eacc of the cavity reached 29.6 MV/m at a Q0 = 2.7×1010 without experiencing a quench. The surface morphology and SRF performance of the cavity provided validation that both the cathode surface area and the applied parameters fell within an optimal range.
